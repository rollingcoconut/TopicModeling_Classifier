Many economists see a data revolution that could transform their field opening a window to seeing and measuring economic behavior in greater detail than ever before. The potential — and limitations — of what can be thought of as Big Data economics was the topic of my column over the weekend.

The idea is that better measurement will inform better management of the economy. It is true as they say in business that you can’t manage what you can’t measure. But just because you can measure something doesn’t necessarily mean you can manage it — especially in the messy realm of human affairs.

What about a more targeted approach? That is trying to get a better reading on one crucial slice of the economy to guide policy and perhaps behavior. That in broad strokes is the animating philosophy behind the Office of Financial Research a unit of the Treasury Department established by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

The precise recipe of causes — and apportioning responsibility — for the financial crisis is open to debate. But it is clear that leaders in the financial industry and policy makers were largely blindsided. Regulators and bankers lacked the data and analysis to see all the hidden risks in the financial system.

One of the lessons of the crisis said Richard Berner director of the Office of Financial Research is that there were “serious deficiencies” in financial measurement. More stringent reporting requirements is one way to close some of the gaps. “The crisis really did spawn a lot of data collection efforts” said Mr. Berner a former adviser to the Treasury and former chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

After delays Mr. Berner was nominated by the Obama administration and confirmed by the Senate this year.

The data analysis by the Office of Financial Research Mr. Berner said needs to balance the need for more detailed data collection with the need for data security protecting the trade secrets of investment banks and other financial institutions.

Yet added collection of data on money market funds credit-default swaps financial leverage and counterparty risk exposure he said could make it possible for financial institutions themselves as well as regulators to have early-warning signals of trouble.

Mr. Berner said his office was looking at a “variety of approaches” to get a faster handle on emerging risks. One that looks intriguing is a proposal in a research paper that combines data analysis financial economics and computer science.

In the paper the authors contend that new streams of financial data — aggregated properly encrypted and then analyzed — could give strong clues to hidden risk bombs in the system like the institutions that touched off the crisis in the fall of 2008 Lehman Brothers and the American International Group.

Such data the article argues could “have played a critical role in providing regulators and investors with advance notice of A.I.G.’s unusually concentrated position in credit-default swaps as well as the exposure of money market funds to Lehman bonds.”

“This is an effort to use technology to simplify some of the challenges created by our technology-driven financial markets” said Andrew W. Lo one of the article’s authors and an economist and finance expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management.

The other co-authors of the paper “Privacy-Preserving Methods for Sharing Financial Risk Exposures” are Emmanuel A. Abbe a computer scientist now at Princeton University and Amir E. Khandani a financial engineer at Morgan Stanley."
_AGGREG,Aug_29_2012_Q&A:_Hiding_From_People-Search_Sites.txt,"Q.

I recently found my name address and other personal information listed on this Web site called Spokeo.com. How do they get this information and can I delete it?

A.

Although it may seem creepy Spokeo and similar people-finder databases on the Web claim they get their aggregated data from publicly accessible sources — like phone listings and real-estate records. If you have a public profile on a social-networking site information may be included as well.

While Spokeo posts a disclaimer at the bottom of a listing page stating that it does not verify the information (and that it should not be used for official purposes like credit scores or eligibility for employment or insurance) you never know who is looking at these things. If you want to remove your name from the database the company has a removal request form at the bottom of the page here.

You need to paste the URL for your listing into a box on the form type in the Captcha code on the page and provide an e-mail address for the site to send you a verification message. (You may want to provide a little-used e-mail address or one designated for spam collection here.) Once you verify your request your Spokeo listing should be removed within one business day. If you still find yourself listed on the site Spokeo suggests contacting its customer service department for help.

Spokeo is just one of many data-aggregation sites around the Web devoted to people search. Removing yourself from an online database does not remove the information fully from the Internet if it was culled from a public record; it just removes your listing from that particular site.

Still if you keep finding yourself in these online lookup databases that rank so highly in search listings you can try requesting removal from each one. The New York Law Thoughts blog has a helpful list of other online databases that you may want to contact about removing your information. Commercial services like those at myID.com and Reputation.com offer to do it for you but for a price."

Tableau 10 brings about a host of new features including updated designs analytical functions new mobile capabilities and additional enterprise tools for IT managers.

“The new design makes data the hero” Tableau co-founder Chris Stolte said in a statement. “Data integration helps maximize time spent on analysis. Data analytics innovations like the drag and drop clusters help people do more advanced analysis of their data without needing to program. And enterprise advancements continue to up the standard for delivering a governed trusted self-service environment.”

The update labeled as one of Tableau’s “most significant releases” signals a shift for the company as it focuses more on IT and enterprise tools. It also comes as Tableau tries to get its stock price back to pre-2016 levels.

In the fourth quarter of 2015 the company posted a record $203 million in revenue but took a $41 million loss. As a result its stock lost about half its value and has yet to fully recover. The company’s stock fell again the following quarter and has dropped nearly 50 percent in the past year now trading at $54.25.

Tableau is facing increased competition in the data analytics industry from companies like Microsoft which launched its PowerBI tool this past summer.

Earlier this year Tableau CEO Christian Chabot said that more of the company’s business is “leading to cloud analytics” via its cloud product Tableau Online.

Tableau which scaled back hiring plans by 50 percent earlier this year beat revenue expectations for the most recent quarter. However it missed on earnings estimates which sent its stock down another five percent. During Q2 Tableau added 3900 new customers its most ever for a single quarter bringing its customer base to more than 46000 across the globe."

_AGGREG,Feb_28_1994_A_Push_for_Surveillance_Software.txt,"In the age of computer communications and digital telephone calls the American people must be willing to give up a degree of personal privacy in exchange for safety and security the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.

In an interview on Friday Louis J. Freeh the F.B.I. Director defended proposed legislation that critics say would turn the nation's telephone network into a vast surveillance system. He said taxpayers would be asked to pay up to half a billion dollars to develop and deploy the necessary network software.

The Administration wants to impose new technology that would enable law-enforcement agents to gather a wealth of personal information by monitoring citizens' calling patterns and credit card transactions over the telephone network -- and over the two-way cable television networks being planned by cable and phone companies. The system would go well beyond current wiretapping technology because much of the information could be gleaned without the police or F.B.I. actually having to eavesdrop on specific voice or electronic-mail conversations.

""The costs are high but you have to do a cost-benefit analysis"" said Mr. Freeh who insisted that fighting terrorists and criminals was the Government's intention -- not playing Big Brother to the citizenry. 'A Credible Solution'

""The damage to the World Trade tower and the economic interests of the country are conservatively estimated at $5 billion"" he said citing last year's bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. ""I think the American people will agree that this is a credible solution to the problem we face.""

The Administration is trying to line up Congressional support for the legislation called the Digital Telephony and Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994 before having it formally introduced.

Government officials say traditional wiretapping is becoming increasingly difficult because more and more phone calls and data communications are transmitted as streams of digital information -- representing the ones and zeros understood by computers. Thousands of such calls may intermingle on a public-network circuit at any moment. Proponents of the legislation say new software placed on computerized network switching equipment is necessary to help law enforcement sort through this traffic.

But executives of McCaw Cellular Communications the nation's biggest cellular telephone company told Mr. Freeh and White House officials at a meeting on Thursday that their newest telephone switches already provide the surveillance capabilities requested in the legislation.

Moreover privacy advocates say the Government can point to no case in which digital network technology alone has impeded an investigation. And they note that in the World Trade Center case it was not electronic communications but mundane bungling of vehicle and warehouse rentals that led to arrests. An Electronic Portrait

Such critics have long warned that in the information age it is possible to build a detailed model of an individual's behavior political and sexual preferences social network and travel itineraries simply by examining telephone-calling patterns and credit card purchases.

Some capabilities were demonstrated when law-enforcement agents pieced together a chronological list of phone calls made by the people accused of plotting and carrying out the attack in January on the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. But the type of software the Clinton Administration wants to add to the public communications network would make possible much more detailed records of individuals' electronic activities.

""It will be possible to develop a life-size portrait about you as a person"" said Jerry Berman executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation a Washington privacy-rights lobbying group. ""This is not just about a phone number.""

For the Administration having taxpayers rather than communications companies pay for the system is meant to dilute industry criticism of the plan which has met resistance since it was disclosed a few weeks ago. Congressional support is difficult to gauge.

""The bill has some significant problems we need to resolve"" said Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California and chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights. ""The profiling and the tracking aspect of the bill is something we are concerned about.""

A version of the legislation was first proposed in 1991 by the Bush Administration at the urging of the Justice Department. But unlike that version the new bill would limit the surveillance to public networks and not include company phone systems -- private branch exchanges or PBX's -- or private corporate computer networks.

Despite those changes civil liberties groups and some industry executives say they are concerned that the scope of the new bill would give law- enforcement agencies new access to a vast amount of ""transactional"" or billing information related to the setup of a telephone call.

Under current law obtaining a subpoena to obtain transactional data from the telephone company is easier than getting a wiretap warrant to eavesdrop on actual conversations which requires a judge to find probable cause that a crime has taken place."
_AGGREG,Aug__2_2016_From_Being_Employees_at_Facebook_to_Understanding_Big_Data_Analytics.txt,"Big data has found its place in a multiple number of industries today. From e-commerce marketing tools fashion and hiring portals and IoT sectors its presence is felt in all corners of the business domains. But is that all it is capable of?

Not really!

Qubole – is a Big Data Service start-up headquartered out of Mountain View California with their Engineering Team in Bangalore India. Qubole was founded by Joydeep Sen Sarma along with his IIT-Delhi batchmate Ashish Thusoo with the aim of deploying data analytics architecture quickly and saving costs by taking analytics directly to the cloud where all their data is being stored.

Qubole simplifies the provisioning management and scaling of big data analytics workloads leveraging data stored on Amazon Web Services Google Compute or Microsoft Azure infrastructure. With Qubole connected to your choice of cloud provider once IT sets policies any number of data analysts can be set free to collaboratively “click to query” with the power of Hive Spark Presto and many others in a growing list of data processing engines.

From Facebook Executives to Entrepreneurs

Joydeep Sen Sarma and Ashish Thusoo were part of building and leading the original Facebook Data Service Team from 2007-2011 during which they authored many prominent data industry tools including the Apache Hive Project.

While making valuable contacts and money at their job both of them saw an emerging opportunity which they wanted to seize. According to Joydeep many companies were struggling to solve problems that they had been solving at Facebook.

“One of our core takeaways was that software are becoming more and more commoditized today and the problem had moved to that of helping businesses keep their open-sourced software to achieve some business objectives” he said.

At Facebook the duo also realized the value of making technology accessible to users. Joydeep believes that there are a lot of cool technologies out there but there was also a huge challenge in getting the large companies housing data scientists business analysts and data miners to use them.

Apart from learning and helping the company develop new technology; both Ashish and Joydeep also learnt the nuances of work culture at Facebook. Fast moving work atmosphere easy hierarchy giving more freedom to co-workers taking on more responsibility and customer –focussed growth are few things that got ingrained in the DNA of these two founders.

Potential of Big Data in the Indian Market

Talking about the potential in this space Joydeep said that apart from catering into home-borne e-commerce IoT and taxi industries the company also sees product development opportunities in the MNCs that are based out of India. “If you look at Bangalore and Hyderabad MNCs are often building analytics which is another customer segment we can capture here” he explained.

Adding to this Ashish also noted that data crunching companies data analytics for online fashion portals and messenger apps are other emerging industries where Qubole sees immense potential.

Bullish on Enterprise tech companies in India

In January 2016 Qubole closed a $30m Series C funding round led by IVP bringing its total funding to $50m. Some of its marquee clients in India include Ola Cabs Saavn and Capillary Technologies while internationally its clients include Pinterest Quora and Comcast.

Apart from Qubole investors and institutes like NASSCOM have shown immense amount of interest in the B2B space this year. Joydeep said he is very “bullish” on enterprise tech in India.

He claims that lack of a good market for B2B tech and skilled product engineers left this sector dry all these days. However the emergence of good B2B companies and the first generation of startups are now acting as kernels for the next generation of enterprise tech companies."

“N.S.A. Examines Social Networks of U.S. Citizens” (front page Sept. 29) reported that the National Security Agency was using large computerized records about the “social networks” of millions of Americans to hunt for possible links between foreign intelligence and people in the United States. The agency’s approach is not entirely new.

Thirty years ago in 1983 the Internal Revenue Service tried matching family-by-family commercial marketing information with the tax returns of about two million people in Brooklyn Wisconsin Indiana and Nevada to see if it could spot those who had not submitted a proper tax return.

When information about the experiment became public and the Direct Marketing Association strenuously objected the I.R.S. backed away from its plan to exploit what at the time was considered notoriously inaccurate “social” information for enforcement purposes.

_AGGREG,Aug_16_2016_Business_intelligence_data_analytics_users_in_U.S._say_structured_data_tops_unstructured_data.txt,"The lion’s share of business intelligence (BI) data analytics users in the United States taking part in a recent Clutch survey regard structured data like internal information as more important than unstructured data such as social networks.

In all 83% of the 291 respondents who use BI data analytics tools – BI data refers to the process and tools used to analyze data – for their jobs say structured forms of data are more valuable than unstructured data.

(Respondents who only used spreadsheets or free web analytics tools were eliminated.)

More than half 54% of participants in Clutch’s 2016 BI Data Analytics Survey conducted throughout February work at companies with 500-plus employees and 35% at companies with 1000-plus employees B2B research firm Clutch reported Tuesday.

While there is increasing emphasis on the untapped potential of unstructured forms of data – including the Internet of Things (IoT) social networks and external data – surveyed BI users still emphasize the importance of internal business systems and structured data.

“These traditional data types are popular with analysts because they are structured” Clutch explains in the statement.

“This means the information easily can be put into a database and searched and is more accessible than unstructured data such as IoT and social networks data” the company notes.

“All the old-school data is in a structured form so you can put it in the database apply algorithms and get value from it much quicker” Dean Abbott co-founder and chief data scientist for SmarterHQ points out.

Conversely newer types of data are not in “a user-friendly form” Abbott says.

“Sorting through vast amounts of data is not an easy task especially with the increasing prevalence of unstructured data such as text music and images” note the survey findings.

Unstructured data is more difficult to work with because existing BI tools assume data is structured the findings say. “To analyze unstructured data analysts first must convert it into its structured form an extra often time-consuming task.”

Even so “as technology improves it is easy to imagine the value of unstructured data surpassing that of structured data” the survey findings note.

“Eventually we’ll be able to handle a lot of unstructured social data in an automatic way instead of converting unstructured data into its structured form. Once we get there we will see huge adoption” Abbott contends.

As it stands beyond ease of use data generated internally by an organization was seen as more valuable.

In all 65% of respondents rank internal data as more important than data collected outside the company while 29% regard external data as more important.

As well 66% of respondents say business systems data is more valuable than IoT (17%) and social networks (16%) data.

An organization’s internal data represented the most frequent stop for analysts collecting and analyzing BI data cited by 70% of individuals polled.

Internal data was followed by business systems data noted by 59% and structured data reported by 58%.

“Internal data is more popular because of its accessibility” notes Clutch. Even so it emphasizes that “a company can benefit from collecting external data as well.”

Carl Paluszkiewicz director of customer value at Denologix maintains that “to understand your consumer you need external data. It gives your company a 360-view of its business.”

“If a company wants to grow its audience it needs to collect and analyze external data – demographics characteristics buying habits – so it can target potential customers better” the survey finding add.

In terms of how BI tools are being used 63% of those surveyed say they tend to adopt analytics software to facilitate statistical analysis 62% to facilitate data management and 42% to facilitate data visualization.

And while 70% of polled BI data users report they are effective at analyzing and managing company data the ability of organizations to maximize the value of data is called into question by industry experts.

Clutch offers a number of recommendations on selecting a BI analytics solution that will help create a comprehensive data strategy and establish clear metrics to track and maximize data value:

define the degree of data analysis the organization needs from the tool;

identify the level of technical expertise available within the organization;

determine whether or not existing platforms will be integrated with the BI tool;

create a clear detailed data strategy before investing in BI tools for the company; and

establish robust metrics to track and prove your data’s value to company executives.

Tracking of metrics – considerations include data reliability and quality data infrastructure (collection organization and availability) and whether or not the data meets a business’ challenges – is a key part of a BI strategy the survey findings note.

“Although skilled data analytics users understand the value and opportunity BI data offers a company business executives and employees who are unfamiliar with data analysis may challenge the importance of investing both human and financial capital in BI tools” the survey adds.

“Today you have endless sources of data that you can use to predict trends so the value of this data is increasing” John Keenan founder and CEO of Anthem Marketing Solutions notes in the survey findings.

“The problem is that you don’t have full coverage of the data. You need a broad range of resources to collect and analyze it” Keenan goes on to say.

The harder part is masking the information. It’s often possible to remove information yourself though it will probably be a time consuming ordeal.

First delete anything too valuable on social networks like Facebook. A full birth date or home address can be used to steal your identity. Personal details can be cloaked using privacy settings that make them available only to friends. Also remove or deactivate social networking accounts you no longer use.

If someone else posted information you want removed you’ll have to reach out to that person. A friend on Facebook may agree to delete an unflattering photo of you. But getting an online publisher or a data broker — a company that buys data from other companies and then sells it to companies that collect it — to remove content especially if it’s truthful and legal can be tricky. Mr. Beal says asking nicely and explaining why often works.

Many data brokers will let you opt out of their databases though you will have to contact each one individually. “You may have to wait as long as 30 days for information to come down. And they don’t guarantee it will come down forever” warns Amber N. Yoo a spokeswoman for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse which has a list of 140 brokers. “It’s a messy and complicated problem.”

Information that is taken down should drop out of the search engines within a few weeks. If it doesn’t submit a request for it to be removed. Google provides instructions but without action from the site owner Google rarely removes content that’s not illegal.

All this can be a headache. A friend who faced a stalker last summer spent two weeks trying to get her home address removed from four Web sites and search engines. The sites cooperated but she said “there is still a ghost presence on Google” even though she sent it multiple removal requests. Google said its search engine reflected content that was available on the Web.

Indeed it appears her address was not entirely purged from one of the sites. She finally gave up after finding her entire address history on a people search site that was charging $2 to see it. It was clear “this whole effort on my part was futile” she said. Many sites including Google and news outlets are in the information business and may be unwilling to remove it especially if it’s truthful. If they won’t act experts suggest creating more good content about yourself like starting a LinkedIn profile and a personal blog to push down the bad to the third or fourth search results screen where few people bother to look. If the content is defamatory — both false and damaging — or otherwise illegal Mr. Beal recommends hiring a lawyer.

Pros can help consumers cope. The best known is Reputation.com which charges $99 a year for its MyPrivacy service to identify remove and keep your information off the Web and out of commercial databases. It also offers technology to stop tracking and data collection using cookies which can help prevent more data from getting out.

Abine which also makes the free anticookie software Taco sells an à la carte service called DeleteMe for removing specific pieces of content. Removing customer information from 16 of the top online databases costs $75 for instance while removing specific search-engine results YouTube videos and Web content is $10 to $50 an entry.

“Very few people would bother” jumping through such hoops on their own said Eugene Kuznetsov chairman of Abine. “It’s purposely made difficult for a person with a full-time job and other things to do.”

_AGGREG,Oct_31_2013_Wrangling_Data_From_a_Huge_Variety_of_Fitness_Gadgets.txt,"Brian Dolan editor of MobiHealthNews an online publication said the way for fitness data aggregators to differentiate themselves “is to win on the software’s user experience.”

He explained “I may just like the look and feel of one particular user interface.”

But bringing in fitness data to one location to make it easily accessible is just the beginning. Once the data is available the next step would be to make connections between for example your sleep history and what you ate the night before. Then if processing is sophisticated enough the app would analyze the connections and make suggestions for improving your life or even predict the possibility of a coming disease.

The technology for such analysis is not quite there yet except for some fledgling efforts. Several additional services though say they hope to be able to offer that kind of analysis in the coming months.

“It’s very important to do analytics” said Cédric Hutchings chief executive of Withings. “We are developing services that will understand the data and provide coaching advice and services.”

If you want to get started using an aggregator a few that get high marks from the fitness industry are CarePass RunKeeper Argus and Tictrac.

CarePass developed by the health insurer Aetna is free. It enables users to connect with more than 20 fitness data providers including Fitbit FitSync iTriage RunKeeper and Withings. Users set goals and Aetna offers some templates like “Fit into my favorite jeans” or “Kickstart my weight loss.”

Or you can create your own goal name it anything you wish and set your own parameters like a pledge to cycle 30 minutes each day.

Using Aetna’s iTriage app users can investigate the likely cause of symptoms find doctors make appointments and upload medical information.

“We are not the best at manufacturing tools” said Martha Wofford an Aetna vice president and head of its CarePass initiative. “CarePass lets you set a goal and then have a third-party app power that goal.”

In the coming months CarePass hopes to add partners that track medication adherence stress smoking cessation and metabolic syndrome.

CarePass said it was working on ways to analyze the data collected. As Ms. Wofford put it the service “will use the data to personalize the user’s experience.”

“There is a need to communicate with the user to recommend things that will work for them” she said.

RunKeeper the popular running monitor integrates scores of apps on its site and mobile app monitoring activities like sleep nutrition and strength building.

The data allows users to make educated guesses as to possible correlations between activities and outcomes or one particular app may call out certain data to the user (“you’ve just gained 10 pounds”). But RunKeeper itself does not currently suggest any connections between activities and outcomes.

Argus from Azumio and available in the Apple app store uses many of its own apps and a few from third parties to allow a user to track nutrition and exercise and even add pictures of the foods eaten to share with friends. Holding down one of the honeycomb data cells on its iPhone app expands the information so the user can see not just overall steps for the day for instance but steps taken hour by hour as well as distance traveled and calories burned.

Tictrac a London start-up is worth watching because it offers some data analysis in addition to linking data from 300 partner apps into its free portal. Through the analysis Tictrac suggests actions to improve a user’s well-being.

Users organize their goals into preformatted “projects” like “time management” “lose 10 pounds” or “run a marathon.” Users can also create custom plans. Each one asks the user to link to the accounts of the tracking devices and apps that pertain to the goals of that project.

For example the time-management project looks at how many e-mails one has sent and received from Gmail the time they were sent and the senders’ names the number of meetings as listed on Google’s calendar how much television has been watched stress levels and other data. The fitness project analyzes what one has eaten calories and nutritional data and exercises performed.

With this micro-information users can pinpoint what changes they need to make in their daily routines to improve their health and well-being.

Tictrac also licenses algorithms to other apps that look at various data and offer suggestions on how to improve performance. For example runners may be told that they run faster when it’s raining or even while listening to a certain type of music. That functionality will soon be available directly on the Tictrac platform."

enterprise. Perhaps even a better match than your favorite cloud based CRM
HR/Finance system or social media platform. Why? because even Facebook started
small and grew one college campus at a time. But for a global corporation the
fundamental data set covers most of the Earth which occupies an area of 197
million square miles! Today’s maps contain the vastness of our environment
resources property and populations. We have maps of all types with enough
precision to support navigation systems. Satellite images are taken from miles
up to achieve resolutions of a few dozen centimeters. Birdseye views are taken
by circling planes to give us pictures from several perspectives. Planes and
drones take lidar images using lasers to create high precision 3Dmodels of
buildings and objects. Maps track mountain tops and ocean depths rural areas
and cities. We track properties points of interest the locations of phone
towers their signal coverage and the wires and gas pipes under our streets.
And all of these have metadata to track how things are used owned proposed
and what they’re contained within. Containership leads to databases’s of virtual
boundaries for continents countries regions states counties zip codes and
parcels. There are databases containing the location of every significant point
on the planet and algorithms to interpolate between them togeocode andadd new
locations. Andamazingly much of this information is changing all of the time! On
top of this with the advent of IoT we’re poised to generate more data than has
ever been seen before as devices provide constant streams of data about where
they are and what they’re doing at any given moment. The cloud offers ways to
store and analyze this vast amount of data and we have access to it from the
devices in our lives and the apps we use throughout our enterprises. But it
wasn’t always so. In the early days of GIS technology the tools were relatively
niche and required skills akin to specialized engineering disciplines. Not
surprisingly folks with such skills often learned them in the military or the
federal government. The military applications for GIS are obvious and one can
imagine the amount of work required to manage the country’s various resources.
At that time GIS software was expensive proprietary and had limited
scalability. Mapping applications were fat client tools which required large
file shares of data and images-something very difficult to extend across a WAN
for example which often caused mapping departments to be fairly centralized.
Adding GIS features to an order processing system to embed a map or to geocode
an address was often difficult and required complex low level code. The software
itself was only part of the problem. The bigger complexity was data. Not just
the amount but the logistics of coordinating disparate sources: Local and
federal governments 3rd party in house -often overlapping inconsistently
tagged and released at varying schedules. Mapping vendors bundled datasets to
hide much of this but their data often required being supplemented with
additional data–such as higher quality images. Coordinating the data sources was
critical for any application so there was a huge need for careful release
management often requiring an entire team. Fast forwarding to today’s cloud
apps the accessibility problems of GIS technology is solved by web tools thin
client apps and centralized systems that can be configured once and shared by
many. The challenge of consolidating data still exists but the cloud vendors
hide this from us. Pan along Google or Bing maps and you see the faint logos of
various data providers in the corner along with version information. And on top
of that it’s all changing all the time. The land under our feet seems stable
enough but the data about it is far from fixed and is constantly being improved.
Cloud beautifully solves problems of immense data sets requiring massive storage
and infrastructure data distribution problems high velocity updates and setup
costs. And when you consolidate data for one customer you can leverage it for
many customers while economies of scale make it cost effective to provide the
best data possible. There will always be premium data but thanks to cloud the
benefits are entirely on the side of the consumer. Yesterday’s premium data is
practically free. Today’s premium data such as 3D virtual building models will
be cheaper tomorrow. What started for Microsoft and Google as a way to add
location based servicesto their search productswas considered fairly limited
compared to the more mature features of ESRI.But Microsoft and Google gradually
started to address this–as did the aftermarket and open source community.But
vendors like ESRIwere watching and started to adjust their offerings to be
complimentary rather than competitive with Google and Microsoft. One could
access Bing or Google’s webservices in MapInfo or ESRI’s desktop tools and no
longer need a massive trove of images stored on the network.  But not stopping
there ESRI adapted their server tools to be cloud friendly. So one could
provision a full ArcGIS Server instance on the cloud provider or your choice and
leverage immense data sets choose additional premium data setup gateways to
your own data and still use the high end desktop tools in a subscription model.
So all in all this is the absolute best and most exciting time for companies to
adopt advanced GIS tools and move beyond the basics of out of the box Google and
Bing. Like other Cloud tools you can start small and grow to any size. And
technologies like IoT will create datasets the likes of which we’ve never even
seen that could only be wrangled using cloud tools like Hadoop. We’re certainly
seeing huge growth in several areas: the high end premium mapping tools are
easier to get into the hands of end users thanks to subscription models. And
premium tools are adding new features and data enabling our users to create
sophisticated interactive visualizations and analytics. With the use of web apps
and subscription models these sophisticated data aggregation and presentation
tools no longer require a heavy load on our desktop hardware. This also gives
our revenue producers the flexibility to use and present with the device of
their choice which is key to keeping our sales professionals from outselling.
Due to the proliferation of easy to use web services it’s never been easier to
embed maps and spatial functions to LOB applications–even legacy ones. For brand
new apps we’re often adding mapping front and center to the interfaces where
everything is oriented around location. We’re also seeing amazing integrations
of GIS features in our various 3rd party apps. However the most significant area
of growth we’re seeing thanks to both cloud BI and GIS tools is the growth of
end user self-service solutions. This is aided by many of the younger members of
our workforce coming in comfortable with the tools to create mashups and data
integrations on their own. We’re at a tipping point for a next generation GIS
technology where users will have access to so much location based data and
analytical tools that can handle it the insights possible will provide
significant advantages to those who’ve made the investment.

_AGGREG,Jul_21_2016_Workday_acquires_big_data_analytics_company_Platfora.txt,"Publicly traded human capital management software company Workday today announced that it has acquired Platfora a startup that built software for cleaning up and analyzing big data. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“The acquisition will enable Workday to continually enhance our analytics capabilities — especially areas like managerial reporting and operational analytics where insights are gathered by collecting and connecting multiple data sources (Workday and non-Workday data) to make business decisions” Workday said in a statement on the deal. “Customers want to drill down to transaction-level data and analyze it across multiple dimensions for calculating profitability ROI and other operational metrics.”

Platfora offered companies a way to do business intelligence on top of data stored in the Hadoop open source big data software. Platfora inked partnerships with the Hadoop distribution companies Cloudera Hortonworks and MapR. Competitors include Clearstory Data and Datameer among others.

The rise of Hadoop over the years caused legacy business intelligence software providers to add support for Hadoop as Platfora and others picked up adoption.

This deal follows Workday’s acquisition of online learning platform Zaption last month.

Last year Platfora founder Ben Werther stepped down as the company’s chief executive; SAP veteran Jason Zintak replaced him.

Platfora’s investors include Allegis Capital Andreessen Horowitz Battery Ventures Cisco In-Q-Tel and Sutter Hill Ventures. As of last year Platfora had 130 employees. Customers include Citi Disney Sears and Volkswagen Group. The Platfora team will remain in its headquarters in San Mateo California.

Workday will provide more information about how it will integrate Platfora’s technology into its existing offerings at the Workday Rising conference in Chicago in September.

Cities are our paradises of anonymity a place for both self-erasure and self-reinvention. But soon cities may fall first in the disappearance or at least a radical remaking of privacy.

Information about our innocuous public acts is denser in urban areas and can now be cheaply aggregated. Cameras and sensors increasingly common in the urban landscape pick up all sorts of behaviors. These are stored and categorized to draw personal conclusions — all of it thanks to cheap electronics and cloud computing for affordable sums.

“People in cities have anonymity from their neighbor but not from an entity collecting data about them” said Deirdre Mulligan a professor at the iSchool at the University of California Berkeley. “These are far more prevalent in cities.”

On Friday a company called LocoMobi announced it had acquired Nautical Technologies the license plate recognition technology of a Canadian company called Apps Network Appliances. This gear sits at the entrance of a parking lot identifying the license plates of incoming cars. That data goes to the cloud computing infrastructure of Amazon Web Services. When a car pulls out of the lot the camera takes another picture computers calculate how long a car was parked and a charge is applied.

The company’s co-founder foresees tying the system to a car’s navigation system enabling drivers to find and reserve nearby parking spots without wasteful driving. A license plate is certainly public information and this all seems like a boon for drivers.

Eventually however something else happens too.

“We can have so much fun with this” the co-founder of LocoMobi Barney Pell who is also its chairman said. “Imagine knowing that people who park here also park there – you’ve found the nearby stores their affinities. You could advertise to them offer personalized services provide ‘passive loyalty’ points that welcome them back to an area.”

At that point public data has become personal information. It’s a little like the way a company called Euclid Analytics uses the pings when a smartphone looks for a Wi-Fi antenna (something that phones do as a matter of course) to track people moving through a crowded mall.

Euclid says it does not collect personally identifying information though it could figure out a lot by examining those movements. In London a software engineer inferred a significant amount of personal information by looking at public data about bicycle rentals.

The more recording devices we put in the world the more once-evanescent things take on lasting life. Our speech is increasingly recorded and given new meaning when it is analyzed. This week it emerged that Google has filed a patent to take its Google Glass recording technology (already responsible for a few urban scuffles) onto contact lenses.

Many of the technologists involved in data aggregation see a benefit to civil society. “So many of our urban problems have to do with people breaking rules and cheating systems then disappearing” Mr. Pell said. He noted behaviors like parking in handicapped spaces with illegitimate tags or running red lights. “If compliance is information rich our lives won’t have this death of 1000 little cuts.”

“What happens when every secret from who really did the work in the office to sex to who said what is that we get a more truthful society” said David Friedberg founder and chief executive of Climate Corporation a big data analysis company that Monsanto bought last year. “Technology is the empowerment of more truth and fewer things taken on faith.” Public awareness of now hidden behaviors he said “is a conversation that will happen.”

That sense of where tech will take us is its own faith Ms. Mulligan of Berkeley said. “There is an idea here that data is truth and that’s not always true” she said. “You may know who is running a red light but you don’t know if there is a sick kid in the back seat and they are racing to the hospital.”

More important she said that deferral to data comes at the expense of people making real choices about how to behave. “If you want people to act morally you don’t tell them what they can and can’t do. We all need to think about the effect on others what should be done” she said.

Certainly all these hacks on traditional privacy will not just be urban questions. With the coming of low-cost satellite systems all of the Earth will be held to a mirror in near real time at an increasing granularity of visual infrared and other kinds of data. And while companies may collect our public information the Federal Trade Commission in the United States along with regulators in other countries is increasingly interested in how this data is used.

On the other side it isn’t clear how much we care about our privacy; also this week Google updated its terms of service purposely highlighting the fact that it automatically scans our content including emails. So far this has not resulted in a drastic drop in how much people use Google.

What we have at this moment is an exceptional awareness of where we are going: It is a little bit as if circa 1880 we’d been able to say “soon we’ll banish night because our cities will have electric light.” The only real loss would not be thinking through the implications."

Services like Facebook LinkedIn and Netflix have become essential to modern life as increasingly consumers aren’t just willing to have all their data connected and aggregated online—they expect it.

“And financial services is the same category” says Jim Del Favero chief product officer at the technology-based wealth management firm Personal Capital. “Their expectation is no longer paper statements or poor-quality user experiences. There’s a huge expectation that all of these financial services operate like the other things they’re doing online.”

Over 1 million users are tracking about 250 billion dollars on the Personal Capital platform Del Favero says and more than half of their usage is via mobile. It’s important to note that their customers aren’t just millennials living their lives online. They’re users in their 30s 40s and 50s with complex lives and complicated finances and they want more transparency—and control—over their financial lives and wealth portfolio.

“But the conflict happens when the financial institution says ‘We would rather you go to our site for everything’” says Del Favero. “Traditional FIs want to own the entire relationship. And that’s not something the user is that open to especially after ’08. There’s even fewer people who are willing to put their entire financial life in one financial institution.”

So that’s the opportunity for financial applications that use aggregated data—to link a customer’s accounts including bank brokerage 401(k) mortgage credit cards and loan statements together to view the whole picture.

“It’s about first having access to the raw data and secondly how you transform it how you marry it with other sources of data to add additional value—what you’re going to deliver to users” says Del Favero. “And then it’s about having the high-quality data analytics to look at the data to detect patterns and provide advice.”

This holistic approach to financial services is an opportunity that still hasn’t been fully realized Del Favero says.

“It’s understanding the user in a way that allows you to tailor products and services and allows you to sell them even better” Del Favero explains. “For the consumer it’s really applying data science to understand life events to understand opportunities to improve someone’s situation. How can we analyze financial data to help people make better decisions and actually drive change in behavior? I think that’s the big future of this space.”

The number of opportunities and applications are growing every day says Del Favero and banks are getting left behind.

_AGGREG,Feb_28_2013_Use_Not_Collection_Should_Be_Focus_of_Data_Rules_Report_Says.txt,"Personal data is a valuable asset that ought to be put to work.

Fluid data markets will benefit economies societies and individuals.

Privacy rules should focus on how data is used rather than on the widespread collection of personal data.

That is the gist of a new report from World Economic Forum’s Personal Data project “Unlocking the Value of Personal Data: From Collection to Usage.”

The modern digital world with its explosion of data has made the traditional approach to privacy based on “notice and consent” typically between two parties — a marketer and a consumer — obsolete in the view of the report’s authors.

“The technology has overrun the classical model” said Craig Mundie a senior adviser to Microsoft’s chief executive Steven A. Ballmer.

Mr. Mundie was on the five-member steering board for the report. All five people represent corporations that stand to gain from tapping personal data.

Privacy advocates and regulators in Europe and the United States have been reluctant to give up on efforts to control the collection of data. Their concern is that once personal data is collected its use is very difficult to monitor and control. Information brokers that consumers never see — and few know about — market personal data to advertisers retailers financial institutions and others. That problem prompted the Federal Trade Commission in a report last year to recommend that Congress enact legislation “to provide greater transparency for and control over the practices of information brokers.”

But while recognizing the privacy challenges the companies participating in the World Economic Forum project say what was needed was a careful balance. In a blog post on Wednesday Raymond J. Baxter a senior vice president of Kaiser Permanente a major health care provider and insurer emphasized the value of personal data when used properly. He cited Kaiser’s use of personal medical data for research.

For example mining family data and outcomes over years Kaiser scientists found that the children of women who took anti-depressant drugs while pregnant had more than twice the risk of developing autism disorders. “By discovering this correlation and leveraging this data in new ways lives are improved” Mr. Baxter wrote.

According to Mr. Mundie of Microsoft technology can help strike the right balance between individuals’ concerns about privacy and the benefit of a fluid market in personal data. He said independent organizations most likely nonprofits would develop automated privacy preference services that individuals could subscribe to. A person would check off what he or she wanted his data to be used for and not. Those preferences he explained would then be encoded as software tags that traveled with the person’s data.

Those preferences Mr. Mundie added could vary depending on context. For example a person might say he or she did not want personal medical data shared beyond a family doctor and one or two specialists — unless the person was taken to an emergency ward.

“You can intelligently use computing technology to provide the benefits and curtail abuse” Mr. Mundie said."

Jeff Bezos the founder and chief executive of Amazon was on a roll.

Moments earlier he had unveiled the Kindle Fire Amazon’s newest mobile device a sleek and chic tablet with a full-color touch screen. By all accounts the presentation had been a hit setting off a wave of congratulatory Tweets.

Now he was making himself comfortable in a private room for one-on-one interviews. He poured himself a cup of coffee and settled back to chat.

Mr. Bezos deftly answered a handful of questions none of which seemed to rattle his composure — not those about whether the Kindle Fire could challenge the iPad nor even queries about recent articles exposing harsh working conditions at an Amazon distribution center. He pointed to Amazon’s previous statements on that issue and when pressed for his own reaction he just stared evenly for a few beats. Cool as a cucumber.

But then things got interesting.

The point was raised that although the Kindle Fire is built on Android like many other tablets there was no visible signifier that the tablet was at all powered by Google. No Google-branded e-mail Web search maps anything.

Mr. Bezos nodded saying that to the average consumer the Fire’s software would be “unrecognizable as Android.”

“We used the open-source code directly and built on top of that” he said. “So it’s really our own thing.”

Mr. Bezos added that the company would be “happy to partner” with Google to ensure that the Fire software would work smoothly with new Android releases.

But when pressed about whether his company had been in talks with Google during the development of the Fire he grew uneasy.

“You’d have to ask someone else” he sputtered. “I don’t know.”

An Amazon spokesman Andrew Herdener said on Thursday that the companies had not collaborated. Shari Doherty a spokeswoman for Google said the company was happy that Amazon chose Android as the software for its tablet but declined to comment further about the Fire.

Amazon was not required to work with Google to use its software which Google gives away. But in this case Amazon had a reason to be secretive about its tablet plans — and Mr. Bezos may have a reason to be jittery when the subject of his company’s relationship with Google comes up.

Amazon is jumping into the browser wars putting it in competition with Mozilla Microsoft and of course Google which has been pouring resources into Chrome. But it is going a step further with its Silk browser by acting as a middleman between the Fire and the Web sites a user wants to visit saying it will use its powerful cloud computing resources to speed up delivery of Web pages.

Chris Espinosa the eighth hire at Apple and a senior engineer at the company tossed out a theory this week that Amazon wants to take a bite out of Google using a tablet built on Google’s own software.

“Fire isn’t a noun it’s a verb and it’s what Amazon has done in the targeted direction of Google” he wrote in a post on his personal blog. “This is the first shot in the new war for replacing the Internet with a privatized merchant data-aggregation network.”

Mr. Espinosa points out as other savvy tech writers have in the days since the Fire was unveiled that there are some serious security and privacy implications to the Silk browser. Because its users’ Web traffic is piped through Amazon’s servers it may give Amazon unique insight into the Web clicks buying patterns and media habits of Kindle Fire owners.

“Amazon now has what every storefront lusts for: The knowledge of what other stores your customers are shopping at and what prices they’re being offered there” Mr. Espinosa continued. “What’s more Amazon is getting this not by expensive proactive scraping the Web like Google has to do they’re getting it passively by offering a simple caching service.”

Perhaps the data collected could be another way for Amazon to subsidize the cost of its hardware allowing it to undercut rivals on price. Your average Internet service provider already has access to such data and the mobile Opera Mini browser uses a similar technique. But Amazon is expected to sell as many as five million Kindle Fires right off the bat. This could make the Fire an interesting kink in Google’s plans to use Android to help it sell mobile advertising and build a dominant presence on mobile devices."
_BLCKMLnRAN,Aug_16_2016_Ransomware-as-a-service_allows_wannabe_hackers_to_cash-in_on_cyber_extortion.txt,"Image: Check Point

A ransomware-as-as-service scheme is enabling even the most technically illiterate cybercriminal to extort payments from victims infected with data-encrypting malware -- with the developers of the service taking a significant chunk of the ill-gotten gains.

Cerber is one of the largest active ransomware rings operating today with data collected by cybersecurity researchers at Check Point claiming 150000 Microsoft Windows users were infected in July alone. One of the key reasons it's so widespread is because its original creators are selling Cerber on the dark web allowing other criminals to use the code in return for receiving 40 percent of each ransom paid.

With an average ransom payment of one Bitcoin overall profit from Cerber during July is thought to be around $195000 with the authors receiving around $78000 in that month alone.

In exchange for giving up some of the profits wannabe cyber fraudsters are provided with everything they need in order to successfully make money through extortion of victims of the malware -- it's essentially ""ransomware for dummies"" in an all-in-one kit says Maya Horowitz group manager of intelligence operations at Check Point.

""Our assumption is the affiliates wouldn't be able to create their own ransomware or malware so they'd be willing to pay as much as the creator wants because to them it's either that or nothing. They get a very user-friendly panel to manage the Cerber ransomware campaign detailing how many infections there are on a daily basis how many people pay the income they're generating. It's very much ransomware for dummies."" she told ZDNet.

The availability of Cerber to anyone who wants to pay for it differentiates it from another of the most successful ransomware families Locky.

""Locky is only being sent by one threat actor -- they use it on their own and don't share or sell it. Cerber acts as ransomware-as-a-service -- those who created it are now leasing it for anyone to use"" says Horowitz.

That arguably makes Cerber more dangerous than Locky because each affiliate user can infect victims using a variety of different attack methods although the two most common involve the victim unknowingly executing a malicious program disguised as a legitimate file delivered in a phishing email or the victim is infected browsing a compromised website.

Researchers believe there are currently over 150 active Cerber campaigns targeting users in 201 countries with victims in South Korea the US and Taiwan accounting for over half of ransom payments. Perhaps significantly however Cerber doesn't infect targets in Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Georgia Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Moldova Russia Turkmenistan Tajikistan Ukraine or Uzbekistan. They're all former Soviet states suggesting that Cerber is potentially developed in Russia.

""It's pretty much everywhere except for Russian-speaking countries. Encoded in the ransomware is an instruction that if it finds a machine configured for Russian language then it will not run. That makes us assume the writers are of Russian origin"" says Horowitz.

While the malware authors could just sit back and wait for the profits to roll in -- the original Cerber was spotted early this year -- they're craftier than that. Indeed researchers discovered that a new version of the ransomware Cerber 2 was released in July advertising improvements to the malware.

Image: Check Point

Affiliates are encouraged to become part of the Cerber programme via banners and marketing on dark web forums with claims that up to three percent of victims will pay the ransom. In reality Check Point says only 0.3 percent of victims pay the ransom to regain access to their files.

While that number seems low the sheer amount of Cerber infections means its creators are thought to make almost $1m a year using the affiliate scheme alone. The money made is effectively laundered by passing it through a maze of Bitcoin accounts in order to evade detection.

In order to combat Cerber Check Point has released a free Cerber decryption tool allowing victims to decrypt their locked files without being forced to pay a ransom.

_BLCKMLnRAN,Jul_27_2016_Cisco_Midyear_Cybersecurity_Report_Predicts_Next-Gen_of_Ransomware.txt,"The Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report (MCR) finds that organizations are unprepared for future strains of more sophisticated ransomware. Fragile infrastructure poor network hygiene and slow detection rates are providing ample time and air cover for adversaries to operate.

According to the report’s findings the struggle to constrain the operational space of attackers is the biggest challenge facing businesses and threatens the underlying foundation required for digital transformation. Other key findings in the MCR include adversaries expanding their focus to server-side attacks evolving attack methods and increasing use of encryption to mask activity.

So far in 2016 ransomware has become the most profitable malware type in history. Cisco expects to see this trend continue with even more destructive ransomware that can spread by itself and hold entire networks and therefore companies hostage. New modular strains of ransomware will be able to quickly switch tactics to maximize efficiency.

For example future ransomware attacks will evade detection by being able to limit CPU usage and refrain from command-and-control actions. These new ransomware strains will spread faster and self-replicate within organizations before coordinating ransom activities.

“As organizations capitalize on new business models presented by digital transformation security is the critical foundation. Attackers are going undetected and expanding their time to operate” said Mike Weston Vice President Cisco Middle East. “To close the attackers’ windows of opportunity customers will require more visbility into their networks and must improve activities like patching and retiring aging infrastructure lacking in advanced security capabilities.”

“As attackers continue to monetize their strikes and create highly profitable business models Cisco is working with our customers to help them match and exceed their attackers’ level of sophistication visbility and control.”

(Watch David Goeckeler Senior Vice President and General Manager Networking and Security Business and Steve Martino Vice President/Chief Information Security Officer Security and Trust Organization discuss key findings from the Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report. Courtesy of Cisco and YouTube)

Download the full report here: http://cs.co/6054BIUNk

Visibility across the network and endpoints remains a primary challenge. On average organizations take up to 200 days to identify new threats. Cisco’s median time to detection (TTD) continues to outpace the industry hitting a new low of approximately 13 hours to detect previously unknown compromises for the six months ending in April 2016. This result is down from 17.5 hours for the period ending in October 2015.

Faster time to detection of threats is critical to constrain attackers’ operational space and minimize damage from intrusions. This figure is based on opt-in security telemetry gathered from Cisco security products deployed worldwide.

As attackers innovate many defenders continue to struggle with maintaining the security of their devices and systems. Unsupported and unpatched systems create additional opportunities for attackers to easily gain access remain undetected and maximize damage and profits.

The Cisco 2016 Midyear Cybersecurity Report shows that this challenge persists on a global scale. While organizations in critical industries such as healthcare have experienced a significant uptick in attacks over the past several months the report’s findings indicate that all vertical markets and global regions are being targeted.

Clubs and organizations charities and non-governmental organization (NGOs) and electronics businesses have all experienced an increase in attacks in the first half of 2016. On the world stage geopolitical concerns include regulatory complexity and contradictory cybersecurity policies by country. The need to control or access data may limit and conflict with international commerce in a sophisticated threat landscape.

Attackers Operating Unconstrained

For attackers more time to operate undetected results in more profits. In the first half of 2016 Cisco reports attacker profits have skyrocketed due to the following:

Expanding Focus:

Attackers are broadening their focus from client-side to server-side exploits avoiding detection and maximizing potential damage and profits.

Adobe Flash vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top targets for malvertising and exploit kits. In the popular Nuclear exploit kit Flash accounted for 80 percent of successful exploit attempts.

Cisco also saw a new trend in ransomware attacks exploiting server vulnerabilities – specifically within JBoss servers – of which 10 percent of Internet-connected JBoss servers worldwide were found to be compromised. Many of the JBoss vulnerabilities used to compromise these systems were identified five years ago meaning that basic patching and vendor updates could have easily prevented such attacks.

Evolving Attack Methods:

During the first half of 2016 adversaries continued to evolve their attack methods to capitalize on defenders’ lack of visibility.

Windows Binary exploits rose to become the top web attack method over the last six months. This method provides a strong foothold into network infrastructures and makes these attacks harder to identify and remove.

During this same timeframe social engineering via Facebook scams dropped to second from the top spot in 2015.

Covering Tracks:

Contributing to defenders’ visibility challenges adversaries are increasing their use of encryption as a method of masking various components of their operations.

Cisco saw an increased use of cryptocurrency Transport Layer Security and Tor which enables anonymous communication across the web.

Significantly HTTPS-encrypted malware used in malvertising campaigns increased by 300 percent from December 2015 through March 2016. Encrypted malware further enables adversaries to conceal their web activity and expand their time to operate.

Defenders Struggle to Reduce Vulnerabilities Close Gaps

In the face of sophisticated attacks limited resources and aging infrastructure defenders are struggling to keep pace with their adversaries. Data suggests defenders are less likely to address adequate network hygiene such as patching the more critical the technology is to business operations. For example:

In the browser space Google Chrome which employs auto-updates has 75 to 80 percent of users using the newest version of the browser or one version behind.

When we shift from looking at browsers to software Java sees slow migrations with one-third of the systems examined running Java SE 6 which is being phased out by Oracle (the current version is SE 10).

In Microsoft Office 2013 version 15x 10 percent or less of the population of a major version are using the newest service pack version.

In addition Cisco found that much of their infrastructure was unsupported or operating with known vulnerabilities. This problem is systemic across vendors and endpoints. Specifically Cisco researchers examined 103121 Cisco devices connected to the Internet and found that:

Each device on average was running 28 known vulnerabilities.

Devices were actively running known vulnerabilities for an average of 5.64 years.

More than 9 percent have known vulnerabilities older than 10 years.

In comparison Cisco also looked across software infrastructure at a sample of over 3 million installations. The majority were Apache and OpenSSH with an average number of 16 known vulnerabilities running for an average of 5.05 years.

Browser updates are the lightest-weight updates for endpoints while enterprise applications and server-side infrastructure are harder to update and can cause business continuity problems. In essence the more critical an application is to business operations the less likely it is to be addressed frequently creating gaps and opportunities for attackers.

Cisco Advises Simple Steps to Protect Business Environments

Cisco’s Talos researchers have observed that organizations that take just a few simple yet significant steps can greatly enhance the security of their operations including:

Improve network hygiene  by monitoring the network; deploying patches and upgrades on time; segmenting the network; implementing defenses at the edge including email and web security Next-Generation Firewalls and Next-Generation IPS.

_BLCKMLnRAN,Jun_16_2014_The_€30k_data_takeaway:_Domino’s_Pizza_faces_ransom_demand_after_hack.txt,"Hackers have demanded a ransom of €30000 (£24000) from Domino's Pizza after stealing personal data on more than 600000 of its French and Belgian customers.

The data was allegedly stolen during a break-in last week acknowledged by Domino’s France which saw 592000 French and 58000 Belgian customer records exposed.



A posting by the hackers on text-hosting site Pastebin claims that the stolen data includes customers' full names addresses phone numbers email addresses passwords delivery instructions and even favourite pizza toppings.

""Domino's Pizza uses an encryption system for data. However we suffered a hack by seasoned professionals and it is likely that they could decode the encryption system including passwords"" admitted the official Twitter account for Domino’s France.

“This is why we recommend that you change your password for security reasons. We strongly regret this situation and take illegal access very seriously.""

'Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us'

The hackers a group calling themselves Rex Mundi posted a sample of the stolen user data along with a demand for €30000 to not publish the full set.

“If you're a @dominos_pizzafr customer u may want to know that we have offered Domino's not to publish your data in exchange for €30000” Rex Mundi posted on Twitter before its account was suspended.

“Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us. If they do not do so we will post the entirety of the data in our possession on the internet” the hackers said.

Domino’s Netherlands spokesperson Andre ten Wolde told De Standaard that the company would not be paying the ransom and that financial data had not been stolen.

'Theft of personal information is bad news'

A Domino’s UK spokesperson said that Domino’s France and Belgium are not part of the same franchise group as Domino’s Pizza in the UK which is operated by Domino’s Pizza Enterprises which holds the “master franchise” for Domino’s Pizza in Australia New Zealand France Belgium the Netherlands and Monaco.

It is currently unknown whether user data from Australia New Zealand the Netherlands and Monaco was also compromised.

Domino’s Pizza Group owns and operates the Domino’s Pizza franchises in the UK and Ireland as well as Germany Switzerland Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.

“The data hacking is isolated to the Domino’s franchise in France and Belgium and no customer credit card or financial information was compromised"" said a Domino’s Pizza Group PLC spokesperson in a statement emailed to the Guardian. ""Domino’s customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland are not affected by this incident. The security of customer information is very important to us. We regularly test our UK website for penetration as part of the ongoing rigorous checks and continual routine maintenance of our online operations.”

“Once again we have an example of how customer data if not adequately secured can fall into the wrong hands” said David Emm senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The fact that credit card details and other financial data weren’t stolen in this case is good but the theft of personal information is bad news for customers too.”

The Domino’s Pizza break-in is the latest attempt by the hacker group Rex Mundi to extort money from global companies by stealing user data. In 2012 the group stole and published online loan-applicant details from thousands of users from US payday loan company AmeriCash Advance.

Belgian internet hosting company Alfa Hosting became another of Rex Mundi’s victims suffering a break-in this year leading to the names of 12000 customers being published online.

“One of the possibly more concerning things is that in a copy of the original notice the hacker group published the passwords appear to be in plain text"" said Jon French security analyst at AppRiver. ""It’s possible they cracked or used rainbow tables to get the passwords but if the passwords were actually stored in plain text that’s a big no-no on Dominos part.""



'Path of least resistance'

“Cybercriminals are after the money and will follow the path of least resistance to get to it. Usually this means stealing personal data which is often unencrypted and selling it on the black market or in this case using it for cyber blackmail” Jason Hart vice president of Cloud Solutions at SafeNet.

“The latest breach continues to raise public awareness of the need for encryption – not just of financial data but also wider customer information. Breaches will happen and you can’t stop them. The issue is – are you able to protect your sensitive data when a breach happens?” explained Hart.

Feedly Evernote and many other sites and online services have recently been targets for extortion with hackers demanding money to avoid being taken offline by distributed denial of service attacks which overload the servers of the website or service preventing users from access it.

“This is slightly different to what we saw last week when Feedly and Evernote were targeted by DDoS extortion attacks” explained George Anderson director of security firm Webroot.

“Usually organisations that give in and pay are spared being DDoSed – but only because following through with a DDoS attack requires slightly more effort on the hackers’ side than publishing the data that has already been downloaded.”

“Companies that fall victim to money extortion attacks should under no circumstances agree to play by hackers’ terms” Anderson said.

_BLCKMLnRAN,Feb__3_2015_Hackers_holding_websites_to_ransom_by_switching_their_encryption_keys.txt,"Ransomware – hacking and locking a computer and demanding money to let users back in – has moved to the web following a spate of attacks that cripple websites by changing the encryption keys needed to keep a website running.



The new attacks called “RansomWeb” as documented by security company High-Tech Bridge see hackers break into a website take control of a site’s encryption system used for securing or backing up data and change the keys.

The attackers are analogous to burglars who break into a house change all the locks and make it impossible for the owner to get back in.

Once the encryption key is changed the website or a web app is rendered inoperable by stopping it from accessing essential information or code.

‘The era of web blackmailing racket and chantage is about to start’

Ilia Kolochenko chief executive of High-Tech Bridge said: “We are probably facing a new emerging threat for websites that may outshine defacements and DDoS attacks. RansomWeb attacks may cause unrepairable damage they are very easy to cause and pretty difficult to prevent.”

In December a company was reportedly held to ransom after a critical web app was taken offline through the attack. The hackers had broken into the servers that ran the web app six months prior but waited until some critical data had been encrypted and the security key stored on a protected remote server.

They then removed the key from the web server breaking the app and sending a ransom demand to the company to decrypt the crucial data and restore service.

“The days when hackers were attacking websites for glory or fun are over now financial profit drives them. The era of web blackmailing racket and chantage is about to start” said Kolochenko.

‘A great opportunity to make money exploiting negligent website administrators’

The attacks are difficult to prevent due to the complexity of most web apps and their constant changing state. Kolochenko explained that the only way to detect such attempts would be to constantly monitor for file changes within the web app code and databases.

Marsel Nizamutdinov High-Tech Bridge chief research officer said: “There are tens of millions of vulnerable web applications with critical data. Hackers will definitely not miss such a great opportunity to make money exploiting negligent website administrators.”

Ransomware attacks are nothing new. Cybercriminals have been targeting people and businesses for years often using emails as a way to carry out the attack. The National Crime Agency (NCA) put out an alert in 2013 when a series of emails claiming to come from banks and financial institutions contained malware that would encrypt a user’s hard drive and hold it for a ransom of around £540.

Cryptolocker then hit the headlines in June 2014 where the managed to take control of a cybercriminal gang’s control system giving people hit with the ransomware a two-week window to clean the malware from their systems.

The move from ransomware to ransom attacks on the web is not unexpected by security analysts who believed it was only a matter of time as more and more crucial corporate data is stored off site in the cloud."
_BLCKMLnRAN,Jun__5_2014_Simplocker_Android_malware_locks_up_mobile_data_and_demands_a_ransom.txt,"A fresh strain of criminal software has been discovered encrypting the data of Android smartphone owners then demanding payment to unlock it.

The Simplocker ransomware scans victims' SD memory cards for certain files including images PDFs and other documents and audio files before locking them using the AES encryption standard according to security company ESET.

It's the first malware found to be encrypting data on Android phones before demanding payment to decrypt it according to a blog post by ESET's security intelligence team lead Robert Lipovsky.

Simplocker asks for a payment of 260 Ukrainian hryvnias (£13) to decrypt victims' files directing them to the MoneXy transfer service.



The malware also sends phone information such as the IMEI number to a server controlled by the attackers which is based on the Tor network. Tor uses encryption and sends communications through a number of difference servers to ensure it’s extremely difficult to track users.

In the case of the attackers it makes their operation that much harder for law enforcement to track and shut down.

Should you be worried? Not yet if you're in the west. Lipovsky said that Simplocker appears to be solely active in the Ukrainian region; is not found on Android's official Google Play Store; and is not currently widespread.

He added that the level of encryption used by Simplocker is significantly weaker than that of Cryptolocker the aggressive Windows ransomware that global law enforcement authorities have been trying to shut down over the past week.

“While the malware does contain functionality to decrypt the files we strongly recommend against paying up – not only because that will only motivate other malware authors to continue these kinds of filthy operations but also because there is no guarantee that the crook will keep their part of the deal and actually decrypt them” Lipovsky added.



Various forms of Android ransomware have been uncovered in recent months. In May security experts warned about a strain called Koler which posed as a porn app. It then sent a message claiming to be from police telling the user they had broken the law by watching indecent material demanding they pay a fine of $300.

Yet Windows remains the number one target for ransomware. The Guardian reported this week that the Cryptolocker malware has infected as many as 50000 computers in the UK alone.

_BLCKMLnRAN,May_24_2009_Stolen_RAF_vice_files_spark_blackmail_fear.txt,"Sensitive files detailing the extra marital affairs drug taking and use of prostitutes by very senior officers in the RAF have been stolen raising fears within the Ministry of Defence that personnel could be vulnerable to blackmail.

Up to 500 people in the service could be affected by the theft. They have been interviewed individually about the possible consequences to them and to their families.

The potentially damaging information was stored on three computer hard drives that went missing from RAF Innsworth Gloucestershire last September. The files were not encrypted so could be opened easily. The RAF disclosed the loss of the hard drives two weeks after they went missing revealing only that the bank details and home addresses of 50000 servicemen and women were on the computers.

It kept secret the fact that the ""vetting"" information about 500 staff had also disappeared. The defence secretary at the time Des Browne was not told nor was Sir Richard Thomas the then information commissioner. The details were also withheld from parliament.

But the seriousness of the potential loss and the nature of the information were outlined in an internal MoD memo which was obtained under Freedom of Information legislation.

It said: ""This information included details of criminal convictions investigations precise details of debt medical conditions drug abuse use of prostitutes extra-marital affairs including the names of third parties.

""The data is not routine vetting information but relates to those cases that have been referred to RAF … because the individuals have serious vulnerabilities that affect their suitability to obtain/retain a security clearance. This data provides an excellent target list for foreign intelligence services investigative journalists and blackmailers. Moreover if the information relating to the private lives of RAF personnel especially of some very senior officers enters the public domain the reputation of the service will be tarnished.

""The vetting information would be likely to generate further interest and due to the profile of some individuals would likely grab front page status.""

Details of the ministry's internal memo will be revealed in the BBC2 programme Who's Watching You to be broadcast at 9pm tonight. The programme will include an interview with an unnamed former serviceman who put the Freedom of Information and Data Protection Acts request to the ministry.

The requests revealed internal concern about the loss from an RAF wing commander. The source now retired handled top secret and highly sensitive information including data on aircraft and ship manoeuvres in Iraq.

At the time of the theft on 11 September 2008 the MoD took more than a fortnight to publicly disclose the loss of the 50000 files.

The drives were kept in a secure area of the base at Innsworth which was regularly patrolled and they were not encrypted. They were due to be transferred to the RAF's air command headquarters at High Wycombe Buckinghamshire.

The ministry seems to have been encouraged by Downing Street into making any information available.

A memo on 26 September reveals: ""No 10 is insisting that an announcement is made tonight and she thinks this is a fait accompli. SpAds [special advisers] here apparently on side … on principle of better to have announced (not very much) proactively than be accused of an attempted cover-up if it leaks.""

The Mail on Sunday reported two days later that the theft involved the loss of personal and career details of pilots ground staff maintenance engineers and civil servants. It reported that Des Browne was said to be "" furious"" and had ordered an inquiry. However a day later civil servants were already planning to play down the story. An update to Browne said: ""Given the relative lack of media attention we do not feel at the moment that parliament will need to be informed about the suspected theft of the hard drives."" In the event parliament was never informed.

The internal vetting memo whose author and recipient have been redacted by the ministry shows that by 2 October RAF personnel were aware of the loss of the vetting files but had decided not to tell any of the senior people affected.

Yesterday the ministry said that they had since interviewed all the people whose vetting records were stolen to warn them of the theft – though this was not done until a few months after it occurred.

Browne who was shown the memo by the Guardian said he was not aware of the loss before he was replaced by John Hutton as defence secretary on 3 October. Nor do any documents suggest his private office was informed.

The MoD yesterday defended its decision not to acknowledge that the sensitive personal information had been stolen.

In a statement to the programme the MoD said: ""Every data loss incident is extremely regrettable and treated with the utmost seriousness. The response to the incident was at the highest levels of the department. Our two concerns were to ensure that any person affected was made aware as quickly as possible while at the same time not placing into the public domain unnecessarily detailed information about the nature of the data.

""This would have only served to compound the loss and alert potential criminals to the potential value of the missing data.""

He added: ""This incident occurred during the summer recess when parliament was not in session. The department have made no secret of this incident. We placed information prominently on the MoD and RAF websites and activated an emergency helpline to assist personnel with concerns.""

In a further statement to the Guardian the ministry added: ""All individuals identified as being at risk received personal one-on-one interviews to alert them to the loss of data to discuss potential threats and to provide them with advice on mitigating action.

""There is no evidence to suggest that the information held on the hard drive believed to have been stolen from the secure … site at MoD Innsworth has been targeted by criminal or hostile elements.""

The spokesman confirmed that the people involved were from the senior ranks who had been vetted at the highest level because they had access to top secret information. The information commissioner's office confirmed that they had not been told about the loss of the vetting files only that personal details of servicemen and women had been stolen.

A statement yesterday about the disclosure said: ""People's personal information must be properly protected … personal information sometimes has a value on the open market and can be a toxic liability."""
_BLCKMLnRAN,Oct_19_2013_CryptoLocker_attacks_that_hold_your_computer_to_ransom.txt,"The email from the bank looked innocent enough. It was from paymentsadmin@lloydsplc.co.uk and Sarah Flanders a 35-year-old charity worker from north London didn't think twice about opening it. But the email contained software that immediately began encrypting every file on her computer – from precious family photos to private correspondence and work documents. In just a short time all her files were blocked and then a frightening message flashed up on her screen: ""Your personal files have been encrypted and you have 95 hours to pay us $300.""

Flanders is refusing to pay but fears her personal files are now lost forever. She is one of the lastest victims of a particularly malacious piece of ""ransomware"" called CryptoLocker which is estimated to have targeted nearly 1m computers over the past month alone.

There is nothing new about ransomware – different forms of it have been circulating since as far back as 1989 – but in recent weeks internet security firms have reported a surge in computers affected. Some suggest the malware is ""on the rampage"" with commercial organisations targeted as often as individuals. One version is cleverly hidden in an email complaint from a supposedly unhappy customer.

""If you haven't got a backup and you get hit by CryptoLocker you may as well have dropped your PC over the side of a bridge"" says Paul Ducklin security adviser for anti-virus software company Sophos. Even if you had backed up your files he says if your back-up device was connected to your computer when CryptoLocker struck you may not be able to recover them. Similarly all the files in shared network drives that were connected at the time of the attack could also become encrypted and inaccessible.

What's more while you will no longer be able open read or view your files anyone with the decryption key could easily do so. That means any of your documents containing passwords or personal information along with your photos and videos could potentially be accessed by cyber-criminals – and although there is no evidence of encrypted files being uploaded or sold on for this purpose at the moment it is theoretically possible.

Flanders says she feels violated. ""I am worried the criminals could steal my identity. I had anti-virus software on there but the laptop is 18 months old and it wasn't up-to-date"" she says adding that she is now contemplating buying an external hard-drive. ""I wouldn't consider paying the ransom on principle. The money would go to criminals who have done this to me and will carry on doing it to others.""

She is furious she opened the attachment in the email but says it is easy to be fooled. ""I was expecting a dividend payment from Lloyds for some Halifax shares I had sold so I wasn't surprised to see an email from paymentsadmin@lloydsplc.co.uk. The attachment appeared to be the receipt for the payment. I feel pretty silly now that I clicked on it but the email didn't go to my junk mail folder and appeared genuine with no spelling mistakes and a realistic email address.""

The malicious software – CryptoLocker is technically not a virus but a piece of software – can sneak into your machine via an email attachment or a ""drive-by download"" which you would not even be aware is taking place. If you don't have the latest security updates and anti-virus protection on your computer all you would need to do is to visit a compromised website or click on a seemingly legitimate online advertisement.

CryptoLocker currently only affects PCs and can easily be removed with anti-virus software but its effects cannot. ""I don't think anyone in the world could break the encryption"" says Gavin O'Gorman spokesman for internet security firm Symantec. ""It has held up for more than 30 years.""

Ryan Rubin MD of global risk consultancy Protiviti agrees: ""CryptoLocker has been designed to make money using well-known publicly available cryptography algorithms that were developed by governments and other [legitimate] bodies. Unless you have the key you simply cannot unlock the data that is encrypted.""

The malware uses a well-established form of asymmetric encryption which means it utilises two keys: a ""public key"" to encrypt the data and a ""private key"" to decrypt it. The malware downloads the public key on to your computer but the private key is kept on the cybercriminals' ""command and control"" servers and cannot be found or recovered on your computer.

It is possible to trace where the public key was downloaded from but says O'Gorman ""often the server your PC connects to is a local proxy which doesn't contain the private key"". This proxy server then connects to the criminals' command and control server via a second or third machine which is constantly being shifted about in another country. ""It is difficult for local law enforcement to seize the command and control server because it takes them time to get there.""

Even when police do seize servers of international cyber-gangs he says ""it would not be a realistic or practical"" for them to identify victims and give them their decryption keys.

So should anyone hit by CryptoLocker pay up? ""You'd be in the same situation if your laptop got stolen – it just feels worse because you know that there is someone out there who has got this key. If your data is worth $300 to you it must be very tempting to pay up just in case it works"" Ducklin says.

According to Symantec around 3% of people hand over money in the hope of getting their data back. ""But remember you're dealing with criminals"" Rubin says. ""There is no guarantee they'll send you the key and if they know you're susceptible to blackmail what is to stop them from doing it again?""

Bear in mind that every penny you pay them will fund their endeavours to target other victims. ""If even a few victims pay then the cybercriminals will think they have got a viable business model and keep infecting people and asking for ransoms. If nobody pays they will stop these campaigns"" says Dmitri Bestuzhev spokesperson for Kaspersky anti-virus software.

_BLCKMLnRAN,Oct_23_2015_TalkTalk_cyber-attack:_company_has_received_'ransom_demand'.txt,"TalkTalk says it has received a ransom demand from an individual or group claiming responsibility for a cyber-attack that has potentially compromised the credit card and bank details of millions of customers.

Related: TalkTalk system failure: complex IT needs experienced staff | Letters

The telecommunications and media firm has said it does not know how many of its 4 million customers have been affected by what it called a “significant and sustained” attack on its systems.

A TalkTalk spokeswoman said: “We can confirm we were contacted by someone claiming to be responsible and seeking payment.”



The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the demand saying “everything else is a matter for the police”.



TalkTalk’s chief executive Dido Harding told the BBC on Friday: “Yes we have been contacted by – I don’t know whether it’s an individual or a group – purporting to be the hacker.

“I personally received a contact from someone purporting – as I say I don’t know whether they are or are not – to be the hacker looking for money.”



TalkTalk shares had tumbled by more than 10% at 4pm on Friday as investors worried about the financial impact of the cyber-attack.

Harding previously said the company had assumed a worst-case scenario that all the personal data relating to its customers was compromised until TalkTalk could confirm exactly what was taken.

She apologised to customers for the third cyber-attack affecting the telecommunications firm in the past 12 months but said the breaches were “completely unrelated”.

Harding told the BBC “the awful truth is I don’t know” whether all the data was encrypted adding: “With the benefit of hindsight were we doing enough? Well you’ve got to say that we weren’t and obviously we will be looking back and reviewing that extremely seriously.”

Related: TalkTalk breach: what to do if you're a customer

Harding said Wednesday’s attack on TalkTalk’s systems should be treated as a crime. “Whether it is the US government Apple a host of companies cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against” she said.

The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach amid speculation that the attackers could be Islamic extremists or extortionists.

Adrian Culley a former detective at the unit said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamic militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.”

The claim could not be verified but Culley pointed out that a group calling itself “TalkTalk Hackers” published what it claimed was a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack.

The group posted the message on the site Pastebin which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamist militants to justify the hack. It said: “We will teach our children to use the web for Allah … your hands will be covered in blood … judgment day is soon.”

Culley said the attack was a matter of national security. “By the very nature of who TalkTalk are they are [a] communications service provider they are also part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure so this is a concern not just for the police but the security services” he said.

Prof Peter Sommer from De Montfort University’s cybersecurity unit told the Today programme: “It seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely not impossible.



“One has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt; since they have gone public I suspect that’s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information get hold of the personal information.”

Scotland Yard confirmed it was investigating the breach but said there have been no arrests. In a statement it added: “We are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators. This investigation remains at an early stage. A full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing.”

TalkTalk said it was continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Met to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed. “Unfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names addresses date of birth phone numbers email addresses TalkTalk account information credit card details and/or bank details.”

The firm admitted in its website FAQs section that some of the data was not encrypted but said it believed its systems were as secure as they could be. In a letter to customers TalkTalk’s managing director Tristia Harrison said the company took “any threat to the security of our customers’ data very seriously”.

She said the company had contacted major banks which will monitor any suspicious activity from customers’ accounts as well as the Information Commissioner’s Office.

But the information commissioner Christopher Graham said TalkTalk should have notified the personal data watchdog sooner about the attacks. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I wish we had heard a little bit earlier and we could have been more ‘out there’ giving advice to consumers about what they need to protect their personal information.”

The ICO is already investigating TalkTalk over two previous data breaches Graham added – one in December 2014 and one in August. “The job of the Metropolitan police in this case is to investigate the theft the job of the Information Commissioner’s Office is to investigate why the thieves were able to get away with it” he said.

The ICO can impose monetary penalties for data breaches capped at £500000 as well as enforcement notices. Graham indicated that if the information on TalkTalk’s systems was not secure it could lead to a bigger penalty from the watchdog.

“There isn’t an off-the-peg solution that renders everything secure and in some cases encrypting everything would probably be excessive” he said. “But the big civil monetary penalty we imposed on the Sony Corporation for the PlayStation incident was involving the lack of encryption of customer data – and that cost them £200000. People have got to take this seriously.”

_BLCKMLnRAN,Aug_22_2015_Ashley_Madison_hack:_banking_staff_could_be_vulnerable_to_blackmail.txt,"Companies are being urged to identify employees who could be blackmailed into revealing sensitive market information following the Ashley Madison data dump.

After hackers leaked 37 million email addresses used by people who had accessed the Toronto-based adultery website there are fears that blackmailers will start demanding money to keep the details of extra-marital affairs secret.

Stephen Coty security expert at IT security firm Alert Logic who has analysed the leaked data said that the much more significant problem came from employees being compromised into revealing confidential details about their employer’s activities.

“Companies who have threat research and intelligence analysts should be looking at this data to see what user names or email addresses are related to their organisation” Coty said. “They should modify their email filters to start monitoring any emails coming through that reference Ashley Madison so that they can find if somebody is trying to coerce an employee to go ahead and release company secrets.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Identity protection analyst Adam Levin says Ashley Madison members should come clean instead of waiting to be discovered or risking becoming the victim of extortion

According to his analysis more than 14000 government officials globally had been compromised a revelation that has sparked fears some could be extorted into revealing matters of national security. But Coty said the major threat came from targeting people who had access to market-sensitive information especially those who worked in banks and other financial institutions. “If I’m a malicious actor I’m not really interested in blackmailing these guys for money; I’m more interested in where they work in their corporate information. To me that is more valuable. I can sell that on an underground market I can sell it to a competitor to a startup overseas and make a lot more money than blackmailing a guy for a few thousand dollars.”

Coty said his analysis had shown that hackers also leaked details of the internal structure of Ashley Madison’s owner Avid Life Media as well as its business performance and sensitive corporate information including the fact that it had lent its chief executive Noel Biderman $3m.

The leak revealed that more than 173 million credit cards had been used to pay for Avid Life services in 2014 – a 44% increase on the previous year. Some 9.7 million people had signed up of whom more than 2 million had gone on to become active members. Visitors to the site came from 46 different countries.

“They had every single credit card payment going all the way back to 2008” Coty said. “You should not be holding that information.”

While the focus has been on users of the Ashley Madison site whose slogan is “Life is short. Have an affair” Avid Life had several other adultery sites including Cougar Life and Established Men. “The users of all these sites are now vulnerable” Coty said.

Even those who had used anonymous emails are at risk of exposure. “I randomly picked somebody out from one of the dumped lists and I found a credit card transaction” Coty said. “I could trace it to an address that showed that he was living in a loft in Toronto. It showed he was who he was and that he participated in the programme.”

Coty suggested Ashley Madison would disappear following the furore. “Tens of millions of people’s information is now floating out there. This site is supposed to be anonymous. That’s what they guarantee. Even if you paid to have your data deleted it’s still there. I wouldn’t be surprised if they closed their sites sometime soon.”"
_BLCKMLnRAN,Feb_17_2016_Los_Angeles_hospital_paid_$17000_in_bitcoin_to_ransomware_hackers.txt,"A Los Angeles hospital hit by ransomware swallowed the bitter pill: it paid off the hackers.

Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had lost access to its computer systems since 5 February after hackers installed a virus that encrypted their computer files. The only out was if the hospital paid the hackers $17000 worth of bitcoins the digital currency.



On Wednesday the hospital announced that it had relented.

“The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom” Allen Stefanek president and chief executive of Hollywood Presbyterian said in a letter Wednesday. “In the best interest of restoring normal operations we did this.”

The move is one of the most high-profile examples of a hacking victim paying the fee for so-called ransomware a money-making favorite of eastern European hackers these days.



Federal investigators often discourage victims from paying the ransom out of fear that it just encourages hackers. But that message can be a tough sell. The fraudsters in these cases often customize the ransoms for each victim and set them just low enough to seem palatable if a bit painful.

At least two small Massachusetts police departments have paid off ransomware hackers after they lost access to their files.

The problem for victims is they often lose all access to their computer networks. In the Hollywood Presbyterian case some industrial nurses had turned to fax machines and recording patient notes with pen and paper.

The FBI said it was investigating the breach but it is unclear what role if any it played in the decision to pay off the hackers."
_BREACH,Jun_15_2015_LastPass_Password_Manager_Acknowledges_Breach.txt,"LastPass the online password manager announced Monday in a blog post that its network was breached and that hackers made off with user email addresses password reminders and encrypted master passwords.

Within the security community password managers have long been controversial. Some say online password managers help everyday users become more secure than they would otherwise because it makes it easier to set up complex different passwords for different accounts without having to remember them all. Others have been wary of password managers like LastPass because if the password manager gets breached hackers can potentially unlock all the accounts managed through the service.

Joe Siegrist the LastPass chief executive said the company discovered the breach on Friday after detecting suspicious activity on its network. The company said that it found no evidence that LastPass user accounts were compromised or that hackers were able to get users’ master passwords or passwords encrypted with that user password. But the data hackers did access — including email addresses and password reminders — is still troubling security experts note in that often all hackers need to unlock an email account is an email as a username plus a password reminder.

Tod Beardsley a security engineering manager at Rapid7 said that the attack gave hackers a list of LastPass user email addresses that they could target in so-called phishing attacks in which they send victims emails with links that try to trick users into revealing more data like a fake “Update your LastPass master password” email that can be used to crack their accounts.

LastPass said it would be resetting users master passwords and advised users to turn on multifactor authentication an added security measure which requires a second one-time password often sent to users via text message anytime they log in to their accounts from an unrecognized machine.

The company said it was confident that its encryption measures would be enough to protect the vast majority of its users. LastPass strengthens the keys needed to unlock master passwords by forcing them to go through a large number of complicated iterations. The company appends random digits to the key then encrypts it more than 100000 times which makes it difficult to break stolen hashes with password cracking tools.

The attack was the second breach notification from LastPass. The first incident happened four years ago. The latest attempt to access the company’s passwords was discovered on Friday but a picture posted to Imgur the image sharing site of a Google security warning suggests that hackers may have found a way inside the service as long as three weeks ago."
_BREACH,Jul_21_2015_Ashley_Madison_adultery_site_hack:_will_I_be_found_out?.txt,"The hacking of the dating site Ashley Madison has raised complex questions about online privacy and the safety of personal data but for the users of the site which claims to have more than 33 million members in 46 countries the questions are fairly straightforward: what are the chances my husband or wife will find my profile on the site and what can I do to stop that happening?

This is what Ashley Madison customers or anyone who shares intimate details about themselves on a dating website need to know.

Related: Dating site hackers expose details of millions of users

I’ve been cheating on my spouse – will I be found out?

Your details probably are not available online yet – but they could be soon. The hackers who claimed responsibility the Impact Team said they would release “all customer records including profiles with all the customers’ secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions real names and addresses and employee documents and emails” unless Ashley Madison and its sister site Established Men were taken offline. They did not give a deadline for this to happen so a release could be imminent.

In anticipation that the leak will eventually become public you may want to take pre-emptive action and tell your other half. The relationship counselling service Relate would not say if it had been approached by worried Ashley Madison users but it has issued general advice to people on how to break the news.

Denise Knowles a Relate counsellor said: “It’s good to offer an explanation as to why you thought the affair happened but it’s also important to take responsibility and to answer any questions they have truthfully. Try to think of your partner’s needs when you respond to their questions and remember that they’re likely to be in shock.”

Knowles said there was some hope for couples where one partner had been unfaithful. “Although some relationships never recover others survive affairs and some people even find their relationship becomes stronger once they’ve worked things through” she said.

I think my spouse has been cheating – can I find out?

Probably not yet. The Impact Team released just some snippets of data they had obtained and much of it was internal company data including bank accounts and salary information but they seem to intend to drip-feed information for as long as the sites stay online.

Ashley Madison said in a statement that it had used the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act to “successfully remove all personally identifiable information (PII) about users published online so far” and would continue to do so.

The six places the hackers initially shared their stolen information have since been scrubbed clean as a result but their manifesto – which contains information about two apparently randomly selected users one from Massachusetts and one from Ontario – is still online.

Are all dating websites vulnerable?

Only to the extent that almost any company could be struck by this sort of attack. According to Ashley Madison’s founder and chief executive Noel Biderman the hack itself was carried out by a third-party contractor who had access to the company’s servers. “We’re on the doorstep of [confirming] who we believe is the culprit and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication” Biderman told a cyber-security reporter Brian Krebs. “I’ve got their profile right in front of me all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here who was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.”

Insider threats are something that many companies not just dating sites are vulnerable to. Research from the security firm Centrify suggests that more than half of UK and US firms do not immediately block former employees’ access to critical systems and a third of British IT managers told the researchers it would be easy for an ex-employee to log in and access systems with old passwords.

But dating sites often have security weaknesses that an outsider can exploit as well. In 2012 the online rights campaign group EFF examined eight popular dating sites and found that just one Zoosk carried out simple security precautions such as enabling encrypted connections by default.

What can I do to mitigate the effects of the leak?

Ashley Madison is now offering a free “full delete” to any member though that’s likely to be of little comfort to users given the doubts about the effectiveness of deletion that were raised by the hackers. The site says that untrue and deletion is effective.

“Contrary to current media reports and based on accusations posted online by a cyber-criminal the ‘paid delete’ option offered by AshleyMadison.com does in fact remove all information related to a member’s profile and communications activity” the company said in a statement. “The process involves a hard delete of a requesting user’s profile including the removal of posted pictures and all messages sent to other system users’ email boxes.”

But some experts say they still have doubts about what deletion actually means. “Sure users’ data may have been ‘deleted’ but was it destroyed? Clearly not” said Pat Clawson chief executive of the Blancco Technology Group which specialises in data destruction. “The two are not the same and mistaking one for the other can put companies their employees and their customers into serious trouble.”

Deleting anything from Ashley Madison’s own servers may be too little too late if the hackers already have a copy of all the information stored elsewhere.

Dudley Kneller a partner specialising in technology and intellectual property at the Melbourne-based lawyers Madgwicks advised users to change their passwords and bank pin numbers “to avoid ‘opportunistic’ risks to their information once the information becomes public”.

Will I be blackmailed if the hackers have my information?

It’s certainly possible. Will Gragido head of threat research at cyber-intelligence company Digital Shadows said it was likely that the hack was motivated by a desire to extort individuals.

“The Ashley Madison breach seems typical of today’s more extortion- and ransom-focused attacks” he said. “Certain types of data and online behaviour are simply too attractive for blackmail purposes and adversaries know the power of psychology and emotions when making demands like this.”

He pointed to the “comparatively little Ashley Madison data in circulation” compared with a similar attack on another hookup site Adult Friend Finder. “The attackers want to hold as much as they can for ransom” he said.

Can I sue Ashley Madison?

British users of the site may be able to bring a claim in the UK even though the site is based in Canada if it could be proved the site was processing personal data or conducting commercial activity in the country such as selling advertisements - this is what happened with Google in Spain which led to the “right to be forgotten” being established under EU data-protection laws.

Ashley Madison could potentially be found to be in breach of its obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 and it could also be found to be in breach of contract if customers have paid for a deletion service but their details remain available. The Data Protection Act says a company must take “appropriate” measures to stop breaches of its personal data.

Felicity McMahon a barrister specialising in media and entertainment at 5RB chambers told the Guardian: “Much will depend upon whether they did take appropriate measures something we just don’t know yet. Damages may be claimed where someone has suffered a financial loss or for distress – or both.”

Distress was likely to be exacerbated because of the sensitivity of the data McMahon said. “It might be a breach of data protection if the hackers released information saying ‘Mr Jones is an accountant’ but it would not cause distress. It is very different if they release information saying ‘Mr Jones is having an affair’ and they have pictures of him in a state of undress. And that may also potentially lead to financial loss if the information results in divorce for example.”

McMahon said that those who wished to sue the company would have to apply for a court order in order to remain anonymous. “This is frequently done in actions for misuse of private information where putting the name of the claimant into the public domain would defeat the object of the action” she added."
_BREACH,Jan_21_2009_Credit_Card_Processor_Says_Some_Data_Was_Stolen.txt,"Heartland Payment Systems a major payment processing company disclosed a data breach on Monday that potentially exposed tens of millions of credit and debit cardholders to the risk of fraud in what could quickly become one of the country’s biggest data compromises.

Robert H. B. Baldwin Jr. Heartland’s president and chief financial officer said that his company believed the card numbers expiration dates and in some cases cardholder names were exposed after attacks on its computer systems at the one point where data had been unencrypted.

Once consumers swiped their cards so-called sniffer software captured that data as Heartland sought authorization from the major payment companies and banks. Customers of Visa MasterCard American Express and Discover Financial were all vulnerable.

“We have industry-leading encryption but the data has to be unencrypted to request the information” Mr. Baldwin said. “The sniffer was able to grab that authorization data at that point.”

Data thieves introduced the software as early as May but Heartland did not detect the breach until it was alerted to the activity in late fall. The personal data of 600 million or more cardholders was vulnerable but data security experts suggested data from far fewer accounts had been extracted. Other confidential information like personal security codes is not believed to have been compromised. That might limit damages.

Even so the Heartland breach could wind up rivaling some of the largest data thefts. In January 2007 the discount retail chain TJX revealed that data on more than 45 million customers had been compromised. And 40 million cardholder accounts were exposed in the 2005 data compromise at a tiny payment processor CardSystem Solutions.

Avivah Litan a data security analyst said that the Heartland breach could result in hundreds of millions in losses and other expenses. “If you add it all up including legal costs it could be as much as half a billion dollars in losses — or twice as big as TJX” she said.

Mr. Baldwin said that Secret Service officials investigating the breach suggested that the thieves involved in the attack might be part of an “international ring of hackers that are introducing breaches at a number of financial institutions.”

The Heartland breach also showed that in spite of the adoption of more stringent standards and tougher oversight by banks and credit card companies consumers are still vulnerable. All this is happening after credit card companies and merchants spent over $2 billion on establishing the Payment Card Industry standards Ms. Litan said. “And yet the breaches continue and they get more serious.”

Heartland based in Princeton N.J. works with about 175000 small merchants and processes about 100 million transactions a month. It has created a Web site 2008breach.com to provide information about the incident. Cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized fraudulent charges."
_BREACH,Feb__8_2016_Huge_rise_in_hack_attacks_as_cyber-criminals_target_small_businesses.txt,"It seemed like just another ordinary day for staff at vehicle hire company MNH Platinum. Little did they know that the simple click of an email link was about to threaten their entire business.



It was early last year when the Blackburn-based firm was the victim of a virus which encrypted over 12000 files on its company network. A ransom demand followed – the criminals would decrypt the company’s files in exchange for more than £3000.



With the virus proving impossible to remove without the loss of crucial company data the firm had no choice but to pay up.



“We were completely unprepared for a cyber breach simply due to a lack of awareness of the magnitude an attack of this type could have through mistakenly clicking a link in an email” says managing director Mark Hindle. “I am thankful that we had a lucky escape in that I was able to retrieve the documents that are crucial to the running of the business albeit at a price.”



Related: Hackers are ahead in the cyberwar – businesses need to wake up

The company’s case is not an isolated one and experts are warning that not only are small businesses now firmly in the crosshairs of cyber-criminals they are fast becoming their favoured target – and are often woefully unprepared.



“SMEs have not historically been the target of cybercrime but in 2015 something drastically changed” says Toni Allen UK head of client propositions at the British Standards Institute (BSI).



“The latest Government Security Breaches Survey found that nearly three-quarters (74%) of small organisations reported a security breach in the last year; an increase on the 2013 and 2014 survey. SMEs are now being pinpointed by digital attackers.”



According to the latest statistics released by cyber security firm Symantec more than half (52.4%) of spear phishing attacks carried out using fake emails – carried out in December last year were against SMEs with November showing a massive spike.

The issue of cyber security for small businesses is made even more pressing by new European regulations aimed at protecting customer data. The EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation will come into force in 2018 and could result in companies being fined up to €20m or 4% of their annual turnover whichever is greater for allowing any security breaches to compromise their customer data.



Sarah Green a cyber security expert and business manager for Cyber Security at Training 2000 says that one of the most dangerous phrases used by small businesses is: “It’ll never happen to us.”



“Small businesses may feel that they aren’t likely to be a target due to their size and that hackers couldn’t possibly be interested in what they do – but in reality the exact opposite is true” Green adds.



“Hackers prey on the knowledge that small businesses tend to have lower defences than larger organisations usually due to lack of financial and human resources. By their very nature thriving small businesses are innovative and niche which again is very attractive to the bad guys who may be interested in customer data and intellectual property and know exactly how to pick out the weak targets.”



Stephen Ridley acting head of technology cyber and data for insurance company Hiscox UK and Ireland and a member of the Cyber Streetwise Forum claims many SMEs still have much to do in order to protect themselves.



“Many small businesses are starting to appreciate the potential severity of cyber-attacks. But many still have a long way to go in implementing good risk management” he says.



“SMEs are being viewed as a softer target by criminals and are often a route to a ‘bigger prize’ if they are contracting with larger organisations who may be harder to penetrate directly.”

According to Ridley firms can follow several simple steps to reduce cyber-risks. He suggests using secure passwords such as three random words installing antivirus and malware software on all company devices instigating regular software updates that contain vital security upgrades and educating staff on cyber-risks. Another way of helping to improve security is to subscribe to the government-backed Cyber Essentials scheme.

Duncan Sutcliffe who runs insurance firm Sutcliffe & Co in Worcester has recently taken part in the programme.

“I was aware of the increasing threat to both our clients and our business from hackers and cybercrime but I’m not a techie so I didn’t really know what to do about it. I found out that around 80% of cyber breaches could be stopped by adopting some of the basics” he says.



Alex Fenton a digital business expert and lecturer at Salford University says there is no excuse for leaving your systems vulnerable. “We have seen some high-profile examples where companies have cut corners to save time and money.



“Burying your head in the sand may save money in the short term but the cost of hacking could range from minor inconvenience reputation damage loss of customer data fines and ultimately company closure.”



According to the Cyber Streetwise campaign a cross-government initiative run by the Home Office major cyber threats to SMEs include:



• Ransomware – where a piece of malicious software typically received via a phishing email encrypts all of the data on the company’s network with the perpetrators requesting a ransom (typically £500–£1000) in order to provide the decryption key.



• Hack attack – where a hacker manages to gain access to the company’s network typically by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability within the software allowing them access to the company data. The target will generally be personally identifiable information (PII) on a company’s customers especially credit card information



• Denial of Service attack – when a company’s website is overwhelmed by a volume of data pushed to its servers in a malicious manner. These attacks are increasingly easy and cheap to carry out with some online tools costing as little as £25 per hour.



• Human error – people are generally the weakest link in any security chain and a vast number of data breaches are the result of information being lost or distributed to the wrong person. Even the seemingly mundane can have far reaching consequences particularly where sensitive PII is involved.



• CEO fraud – where a criminal poses as a senior person within the firm either by hacking or “spoofing” their email account and convinces someone with financial authority to make a payment

_BREACH,Aug_16_2014_Supervalu_Discloses_a_Data_Breach.txt,"Supervalu a food retailer based in Minnesota said on Thursday that its cash register system had been breached by hackers possibly resulting in the theft of credit and debit card information from its supermarkets and liquor stores as well as from an array of stores it sold last year.

The company provided a list of 180 Supervalu stores and stand-alone liquor stores and 29 franchised Cub stores affected by the breach which happened from June 22 to July 17. The company said it had delayed notifying customers because it was working closely with law enforcement and a third-party forensics company to determine the breach’s scope.

The company said that it had been able to prevent the breach from affecting all its locations which numbered 3763 as of April.

“The intrusion was identified by our internal team it was quickly contained and we have no evidence of any misuse of any customer data” Sam Duncan Supervalu’s chief executive said in a statement.

But the breach may have gone far beyond just Supervalu’s systems. Supervalu added that a related intrusion had reached the chain stores it sold to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in March 2013. Supervalu continues to supply technology to those stores and those that might have been affected include Albertsons Jewel-Osco and Star Market.

Supervalu and its affiliates are the most recent major retail chain — after Target P. F. Chang’s and others — to acknowledge that its payment systems were compromised by hackers in the last year. In those cases criminals installed so-called malware on retailers’ systems which fed customers’ payment details back to their computer servers.

The issue which first drew headlines in December when Target’s huge security breach went public has become a retail scourge. Last month a joint report by the Homeland Security Department and the Secret Service said hackers were actively scanning software tools that let employees and vendors gain access to corporate systems from afar then deploying computers to guess at credentials until they find the right combination.

After capturing the data the hackers send it back to their computers and eventually sell account numbers on the black market where a credit card number can fetch as much as $100.

“This looks much the same as the attack that impacted Target last year” said Steve Hultquist an executive at RedSeal Networks a security firm. “These breaches continue to demonstrate the sophistication of the attackers and the reward they receive being worth the investment they make in their attacks.”"

A maker of digital toys for children said it had been hacked putting the personal information of five million people including children at risk.

VTech a Hong Kong company that sells tablets and other electronics as educational tools said in a statement that its Learning Lodge database had been compromised on Nov. 14. Learning Lodge is an online store for VTech devices where users can download apps games e-books videos and music all geared toward children.

Hackers were able to retrieve adults’ profile information including names email addresses and passwords. They also obtained secret questions and answers for password retrieval I.P. addresses mailing addresses and download histories.

The compromised database also contained the names gender and birth dates of children which was a bigger concern to security researchers.

Troy Hunt an Internet security expert wrote this weekend that while adults were becoming accustomed to data breaches compromising the identities of children was jarring. The exposed data could allow someone to link a child to his or her parents and pinpoint the child’s physical address.

“I’ve got two little kids and as a father this really made me think about the footprints I’ll make for them online” he wrote.

Motherboard a news site that first reported the breach on Friday said hackers were also able to gain access to photos of children and chat logs. That report could not be independently confirmed and VTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

No credit card information was stored the company said and some of its websites were shut down as a precaution. Officials in Connecticut and Illinois said they planned to investigate the breach according to Reuters.

The hacking at VTech joins a growing list of prominent data breaches in recent years including at major retailers like Target websites like Ashley Madison and corporations like Sony."
_BREACH,Jun_10_2014_P.F._Chang's_Investigating_Possible_Data_Breach.txt,"Photo

P.F. Chang’s China Bistro said Tuesday that it is investigating a potential security breach that may have led to the theft of information from thousands of customer credit cards.

The possible theft was first reported by Brian Krebs a security blogger who noted thousands of fresh credit cards appeared on Rescator a so-called carding site that was used to sell payment data after last year’s Target network breach. Data from the magnetic strips of the latest stolen cards is selling for between $18 and $140 per card.

Mr. Krebs said representatives from affected banks had purchased several stolen credit cards from carding sites and discovered that many were used recently at P.F. Chang’s.

“P.F. Chang’s takes these matters very seriously and is currently investigating the situation working with the authorities to learn more” Anne Deanovic a spokeswoman for the company based in Scottsdale Ariz. said in a written statement. “We will provide an update as soon as we have additional information.”

Ms. Deanovic said the company had not yet tied fraudulent activity on customers’ credit cards to the possible breach. The Secret Service which has been conducting an inquiry into recent hacks at Target Neiman Marcus and others did not immediately return a request for comment.

P.F. Chang’s was acquired by private-equity firm Centerbridge Partners LP in 2012 for $1.1 billion. It operated 200 Asian restaurant bistros and some 170 Pei Wei Asian Diners at the time of the deal.

It is the first significant appearance of information from stolen credit cards since March when data from 282000 cards was tied to a possible breach at Sally Beauty.

If the breach is confirmed P.F. Chang’s will be the fifth major retail chain — after Target Neiman Marcus Michaels and Sally’s Beauty — to acknowledge that its systems were recently compromised. In those cases criminals installed so-called malware on retailers’ systems which fed customers’ payment details back to their computer servers.

A report from Bloomberg identified Sears as another company that had been breached but the company and law enforcement officials have denied the reports.

The tally of customers affected by these recent breaches now exceeds one-third of the American population.

The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe are believed to be behind the hacks and to be part of a broader cyberattack directed at as many as six other retailers according to two people investigating the breaches who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The entry point for each breach differed according to one law enforcement official. At Target it was believed to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. Criminals were able to use the company’s log-in credentials to gain access to Target’s systems and eventually to its point-of-sale systems.

On Tuesday a joint report by the Ponemon Institute an independent security research firm and DB Networks a database security firm found that retail companies are still unprepared for such attacks.

In a survey of 595 computer-security experts in the United States the majority — 64 percent — believed their organizations still lack the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks. Only one-third said they do the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases. Another 22 percent admitted that they do not scan at all.

“The best approach to avoid an attack on a retail organization is continuous monitoring which helps you understand your environment to detect gratuitous or anomalous traffic” said Larry Ponemon the founder of the Ponemon Institute in an interview Tuesday. “All it takes is one successful attack.”"

Sony has finally agreed to testify before a Congressional hearing that will be held by Representative Mary Bono Mack the chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Commerce Manufacturing and Trade.

The hearing will address the massive data breach that occurred last month on Sony’s PlayStation Network and jeopardized millions of customers’ personal information.

Sony had declined to attend a previous hearing by the same subcommittee saying at the time that it was currently involved in an “ongoing intensive investigation and management of this criminal cyberattack.” The previous hearing explored “The Threat of Data Theft to American Consumers” and the lack of privacy legislation to protect Americans.

Ken Johnson senior adviser and spokesman for Ms. Mack said in an e-mail that the new hearing would focus on data security in the United States. It is scheduled for Thursday June 2.

Epsilon a company that handles customer e-mails for many major corporations has also agreed to testify before the subcommittee. A recent data breach at Epsilon exposed millions of people’s e-mail addresses and passwords.

“Both Sony and Epsilon have agreed to testify” Mr. Johnson said. “Representing Sony will be Tim Schaaff president of Sony Network Entertainment International as well as Epsilon General Counsel Jeanette Fitzgerald.”

Sony also finally answered a number of questions asked by the subcommittee in a May 17 letter pertaining to the data breach and the steps Sony took to protect its 77 million customers.

Since the huge cyberattack on the PlayStation Network Sony has become the poster child for data and security reform in Congress.

“While Chairman Bono Mack remains critical of Sony’s initial handling of the data breaches she also is appreciative that the company has now agreed to testify” said Mr. Johnson. “The chairman firmly believes that the lessons learned from both the Sony and Epsilon experiences can be instructive and guide us as we develop comprehensive data protection legislation.”

Mr. Johnson said the subcommittee is expected to introduce new data and security legislation in the next few weeks."

Before the attack Target installed security software created by FireEye a security firm based in Milpitas Calif. according to two researchers who spoke on the condition of anonymity citing client confidentiality.

FireEye’s software as it turns out worked as intended.

The security breach which Adobe called a part of a “sophisticated attack” also allowed hackers to obtain encrypted passwords and other personal information from customers.

Hackers also illegally took copies of the source code of some of the company’s widely used products which are run on personal computers and businesses servers around the world.

There was no indication that the attackers obtained unencrypted credit card numbers Adobe said in a statement. As a precaution however the company said it had notified customers and credit card companies about the breach and reset customer passwords to prevent further unauthorized access.

“Cyberattacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today” Adobe’s chief security officer Brad Arkin wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyberattackers.”

The breach at Adobe is one of a recent spate of hacking episodes at prominent organizations. Already this year hackers have infiltrated database aggregators like Lexis-Nexis and Dun & Bradstreet and the security firm Kroll Background America as well as the National White Collar Crime Center which helps businesses protect their computer systems.

Concerns about the security of data at Adobe were first raised last week when a technology researcher and an independent journalist investigating the hacking episodes discovered copies of Adobe source code on a server that was believed to have been used in the previous attacks. Brian Krebs the journalist informed Adobe about his findings and on Thursday publicly reported the hacking on his site krebsonsecurity.com.

One of the products that had its source code stolen is ColdFusion which according to Adobe is used by the United States Senate 75 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 10000 other companies worldwide.

Adobe security officials said they were not aware of any specific risks to customers. But because the source code contains the DNA of the software program computer experts said it could allow hackers to find and exploit any other potential weaknesses in its security."
_BREACH,Oct_24_2012_Barnes_&_Noble_Stores_Have_Credit_Card_Data_Breach.txt,"WASHINGTON — Hackers have stolen credit card information for customers who shopped as recently as last month at 63 Barnes & Noble stores across the country including stores in New York City San Diego Miami and Chicago according to people briefed on the investigation.

The company discovered around Sept. 14 that the information had been stolen but kept the matter quiet at the Justice Department’s request so the F.B.I. could determine who was behind the attacks according to these people.

The information was stolen by hackers who broke into the keypads in front of registers where customers swipe their credit cards and enter their personal identification numbers or PINs.

In response to questions about the attack the company acknowledged the security breach saying that as a precaution customers who used their cards at any of the 63 Barnes & Noble where information was stolen should change their PINs and scan their accounts for unauthorized transactions.

A high-ranking official for the company said that hackers had used information from some customers’ credit cards to make unauthorized purchases but that activity had mainly occurred in September and had declined in recent weeks.

The official defended the company’s decision not to tell its customers about the attack saying that the company had informed credit card companies that certain accounts might have been compromised.

“We have acted at the direction of the U.S. government and they have specifically told us not to disclose it and there we have complied” said the official who asked not to be identified because the investigation was continuing.

The company has received two letters from the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York that said it did not have to report the attacks to its customers during the investigation according to the official. At least one of the letters said that the company could wait until Dec. 24 to tell the customers.

As the company tried to determine how the attack occurred it turned off all 7000 keypads in its several hundred stores and had them shipped to a site where the company could examine them.

The company determined that only one keypad in each of the 63 stores had been hacked. Nevertheless the company has not reinstalled the devices.

“Right now we have no PIN pads in any stores and we are O.K. with that” the company official said.

Customers who want to use credit and debit cards now have to ask cashiers to swipe their cards on the readers connected to the registers.

The company said that purchases at its college bookstores and on BarnesandNoble.com Nook Nook mobile apps and its member database were not affected by the hacking. It did not say however whether it would now be telling individual customers that their information had been stolen.

While specifics differ most states including California require that companies notify customers of a breach if their names are compromised in combination with other information such as a credit card a Social Security number or a driver’s license number.

But states make an exception for encrypted information. As long as companies wrap consumer information in basic encryption laws do not require them to tell customers about a breach.

“If you had a breach that included name plus credit card information but the credit card information was encrypted you would not have to provide notice” said Miriam H. Wugmeister a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster.

Computer security experts say such an attack entails a multilayered assault.

“This is no small undertaking” said Edward Schwartz the chief security officer at RSA a security company. “An attack of this type involves many different phases of reconnaissance and multiple levels of exploitation.”

Barnes & Noble did not offer more information on how its network was penetrated. Security experts said a company insider could have inserted malicious code or criminals could have persuaded an unsuspecting employee to click on a malicious link that installed malware giving the perpetrators a foothold into Barnes & Noble’s point-of-sale systems.

“Attacks on point-of-sale systems are growing exponentially” said Tom Kellermann a vice president at the security company Trend Micro. Mr. Kellermann said this was in large part because encryption no longer provided a deterrent for skilled hackers."

This week Ammon Bartram a software engineer and co-founder of SocialCam was talking to a friend about a recent security breach at Adobe in which hackers were able to gain access to tens of millions of encrypted passwords and email addresses.

The friend Mr. Bartram said did not think anyone would be able to find out his pass code from the stolen data. “I’ll bet you $10 you can’t figure it out” the friend said confidently.

Mr. Bartram went to a file-sharing website downloaded a nearly 9-gigabyte file the Adobe hackers had posted online that is said to contain 150 million emails and encrypted passwords for Adobe user accounts and began searching.

Soon after Mr. Bartram said in a phone interview he informed his friend: “Your password is ‘dinosaur.'”

While he took glee in winning the $10 bet Mr. Bartram was shocked by what he found during his search.

“I’ve been able to break roughly one out of every six passwords I attack. That’s something like 25 million broken passwords with associated emails” he said. “This is a big deal. Due to password reuse these passwords will give access to all sorts of accounts.”

While Adobe “hashed” its passwords — which involves mashing up users’ passwords with a mathematical algorithm — the company did not apply this level of security to people’s e-mail addresses or the hints they use when they forget their passwords.

So Mr. Bartram was able to search for his friend’s email address then copy the “hashed” version of the password and search for other people who used that same string of letters and numbers. He found 500 people with the same password as his friend and then searched the nonencrypted hints that people had written if they forgot their password on the Adobe website.

Adobe did not respond to a request for comment.

Even more disturbing he said was the number of people who used the same password for their bank accounts email Facebook and home garage door codes as a password on the Adobe website. Some even used their Social Security numbers as passwords.

In tens of thousands of instances people write a hint to themselves that says “same as my Facebook password” or “same as my bank password.”

Mr. Bartram said this could all have been much more difficult if Adobe had “salted” the data it stored on its users meaning it would have appended random digits to the end of each hashed password to make it harder but not impossible for hackers to crack.

Brian Krebs an investigative reporter and security researcher with Krebs on Security who initially discovered the Adobe breach last month said in a phone interview that Adobe did not put enough effort into securing its users’ information.

“This is a perennial problem for most organizations even the largest ones which should know better but they are still relying on approaches from a long time ago to protect people’s passwords” Mr. Krebs said.

And while Adobe appears not to have done well in protecting data the problem is compounded by users who write password hints that tie back to their banks home addresses and Social Security numbers.

“The best advice is for people not to recycle the same password in multiple places” Mr. Krebs said. “It’s prohibitively complex for hackers to crack passwords that are over 13 characters long; people have to think pass phrases instead of passwords.”

Mr. Bartram said he found a number of email addresses tied to government institutions including senate.gov. “All of this happened because Adobe did not follow best practices for password storage” he said."
_BREACH,May_21_2015_Up_to_1.1_Million_Customers_Could_be_Affected_in_Data_Breach_at_Insurer_CareFirst.txt,"Photo

CareFirst a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan on Wednesday became the third major health insurer in the United States to disclose this year that hackers had breached its computer systems and potentially compromised some customer information.

The attack could affect as many as 1.1 million of its customers but CareFirst said that although the hackers gained access to customer names email addresses and birthdates they did not obtain sensitive financial or medical information like Social Security numbers credit card information and medical claims. The company which has headquarters in Maryland and serves the Washington area said the attack occurred in June and described it as “sophisticated.”

Chet Burrell CareFirst’s chief executive said the company contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation which is investigating attacks against the insurers Anthem and Premera. “They are looking into it” he said.

While it was not clear whether the attacks were related he said the company was under constant assault by criminals seeking access to its systems.

Federal officials have yet to label the breaches at Anthem and Premera Blue Cross as state-sponsored hackings but the F.B.I. is effectively treating them as such and China is believed to be the main culprit according to several people who were briefed on the investigations but spoke on the condition of anonymity. There are indications the attacks on Anthem Premera and now CareFirst may have some common links.

Charles Carmakal a managing director at Mandiant a security firm retained by all three insurers said in an emailed statement that the hacking at CareFirst “was orchestrated by a sophisticated threat actor that we have seen specifically target the health care industry over the past year.”

The Breaches at Anthem which is one of the nation’s largest health insurers and operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and Premera Blue Cross based in Washington State were much larger. The one at Anthem may have compromised the personal information of 79 million customers and the one at Premera up to 11 million customers.

Anthem has said the hackers may have stolen Social Security numbers but did not get access to any medical information. Premera said it was possible that some medical and bank account information may have been pilfered.

CareFirst said it was aware of one attack last year that it did not believe was successful. But after the attacks on other insurers Mr. Burrell said he created a task force to scrutinize the company’s vulnerabilities and asked Mandiant a division of FireEye to perform a forensic review of its systems. Last month Mandiant determined a breach had occurred in June 2014.

Health insurance firms are seen as prime targets for hackers because they maintain a wealth of personal information on consumers including medical claims records and information about credit card and bank accounts.

In recent years the attacks have escalated said Dr. Larry Ponemon the chairman of Ponemon Institute which studies security breaches in health care. He said the health care industry was particularly vulnerable and that the information it had was attractive to criminals who use the data to steal the identity of consumers.

“A lot of health care organizations have been historically laggards for security” he said.

Insurers say they are now on guard against these attacks. But Dr. Ponemon said they had taken only small steps not “huge leaps” in safeguarding their systems.

The motivation of the hackers in these cases however is unclear — whether they are traditional criminals or groups bent on intelligence-gathering for a foreign government.

In the retail and banking industries the hackers have been determined to get access to customer credit card information or financial data to sell on the black market to other online criminals who then can use it to make charges or create false identities.

So far there is scant evidence that any of the customer information that might have been taken from Anthem and Premera has made its way onto the black market. The longer that remains the case the less likely that profit was a motive for taking the information consultants said. That suggests that the hackers targeting the health care industry may be more interested in gathering information.

“It’s such an attractive target and it’s a soft target and one not traditionally well protected” said Austin Berglas head of online investigations in the United States and incident response for K2 Intelligence and a former top agent with the F.B.I. in New York. “A nation state might be looking at pulling out medical information or simply looking to get a foothold which they can use as a testing ground for tools to infiltrate other sectors” he said.

Paul Luehr a managing director at Stroz Friedberg a security consulting firm said the health care breaches could be an entry point into other systems. “It could serve as a conduit to valuable information in other sectors because everyone is connected to health information” he said.

Or the breaches could simply be crimes of opportunity. The hackers could be making off with information and waiting to determine what to do with it.

“We want to jump to the conclusion that there is an organized chain and command” said Laura Galante threat intelligence manager for FireEye who was not commenting specifically on any particular breach. “But what could be happening here is much more chaotic. It’s simply ‘Get whatever data you can get and figure out what to do with it later.’ ”"
_BREACH,Mar_18_2011_SecurID_Company_Suffers_Security_Breach.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The RSA Security division of the EMC Corporation said Thursday that it had suffered a sophisticated data breach potentially compromising computer security products widely used by corporations and governments.

The company which pioneered an advanced cryptographic system during the 1980s sells products that offer stronger computer security than simple password protection. Known as multifactor authentication the technology is typically based on an electronic token carried by a user that repeatedly generates a time-based number that must be appended to a password when a user logs in to a computer system.

RSA which is based in Bedford Mass. posted an urgent message on its Web site on Thursday referring to an open letter from its chairman Art Coviello. The letter acknowledged that the company had suffered from an intrusion Mr. Coviello described as an “advanced persistent threat.”

In recent years a number of United States companies and government agencies have been the victim of this type of attack in which an intruder either exploits an unknown software vulnerability or in some way compromises the trust of an employee to take command of a computer or an entire network within a company.

In 2009 for example Google fell victim to an attack that it said had originated in China and it ended commercial operations in the country in response.

Mr. Coviello said that the company’s investigation had revealed that the intruder successfully stole digital information from the company that was related to RSA’s SecurID two-factor authentication products. He did not give precise details about the nature of the information but said it could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the system in the face of a “broader attack.” The company said that there was currently no indication that the information had been used to attack its customers.

“We took a variety of aggressive measures against the threat to protect our business and our customers including further hardening of our I.T. infrastructure” Mr. Coviello said. “We also immediately began an extensive investigation of the attack and are working closely with the appropriate authorities.”

Company officials did not return phone calls seeking comment on Thursday.

Despite the lack of detail several computer security specialists said the breach could pose a real threat to companies and government agencies who rely on the technology.

One possibility said Whitfield Diffie a computer security specialist who was an inventor of cryptographic systems now widely used in electronic commerce is that a “master key” — a large secret number used as part of the encryption algorithm — might have been stolen.

The worst case he said would be that the intruder could produce cards that duplicate the ones supplied by RSA making it possible to gain access to corporate networks and computer systems. Mr. Diffie is vice president for information security and cryptography at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

In addition to posting the chairman’s letter the company submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it stated that it did not expect the theft to have a financial impact.

RSA was founded in 1982 by a small group of technologists who at times were actively opposed by the National Security Agency which was trying to limit the spread of sophisticated cryptography technology. In 2009 the company said publicly that its SecurID system was being used by 40 million customers. Last year it said its technology was used to secure the identities and assets of more than 250 million people."
_BREACH,Feb_16_2016_Los_Angeles_hospital_returns_to_faxes_and_paper_charts_after_cyberattack.txt,"A cyberattack has sent doctors and nurses at a large Los Angeles hospital back to the dark ages – or at least back to the pre-electronic health record days of the 1990s.

The computer systems at the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center were according to a report on NBC infected on 5 February with ransomware a computer virus that encrypts a target’s files locking the owner out of their own data until a bounty is paid.

In this case the hospital attackers are demanding a ransom of 9000 Bitcoin (about $3.6m) to decrypt the files unnamed sources have told NBC.

Without access to their computer systems doctors are communicating by fax patients have to drive to the hospital to pick up test results in person and nurses are recording patient information on old-fashioned paper charts.

“Things are kind of slow” said Tina Bordas a licensed vocational nurse who represents the nurses at Hollywood Presbyterian through SEIU Local121RN a union of nurses.

Still Bordas said that some “old school” nurses prefered the antiquated system of paper on pen.

“It takes less time to write something on paper than put it in the computer” said Bordas who has been a nurse for 27 years. “A computer screen isn’t that friendly and as a nurse there are certain things that you want to document that might not fit into a computer form.”



Attempts to reach a hospital spokesperson were unsuccessful but a voice message stated that “Patient care has not been compromised” by the attack.

The FBI confirmed it was investigating the attack but would not comment further.

In an interview with NBC Hollywood Presbyterian CEO Allen Stefanek denied that the hospital had been targeted. “It was clearly not a malicious attack” he said. “It was a random attack.”

That may be true but the FBI has raised concerns that the healthcare industry is particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In a private notice to the industry issued in April 2014 the bureau warned that healthcare providers were lagging behind the financial and retail sectors in cybersecurity increasing the likelihood of hacks.

David Ellis vice-president of investigations at SecurityMetrics a data security firm says that the healthcare industry is vulnerable because there is no clear standard of data security as there is in other areas such as credit card processing.

“Fortune 500 companies get it when it comes to the level of security that needs to surround your company and the amount of money that you need to invest” Ellis said. “Healthcare industry security is all over the map.”

Ellis pointed out that hospitals are particularly attractive because of the variety of information they possess including credit card numbers for payments personally identifiable information on patients and sensitive medical information thanks to the nationwide push for hospitals to digitize medical records.

In its 2015 Data Breach Industry Forecast Experian wrote “We expect healthcare breaches will increase – both due to potential economic gain and digitization of records.”



Hollywood Presbyterian is not the only hospital to face such an attack. In January a regional hospital in Mount Pleasant Texas was offline for over a week due to a ransomware attack. The hospital said that it did not submit to the ransom request. In September a hospital in Florida was offline for five days due to ransomware.

The Hollywood hack does point to an increased valuation of medical records by cybercriminals. In 2014 the South China Morning Post reported that records for 10000 patients at a hospital in Hong Kong were held ransom for just 0.6 bitcoin or about $350."
_BREACH,May_24_2014_European_Regulators_to_Start_Inquiry_Into_eBay_Data_Breach.txt,"LONDON — The fallout from the data breach at eBay has reached Europe.

Next week regulators here will begin an investigation into the online market after hackers gained access to the personal data of 145 million customers said Gérard Lommel president of the Luxembourg data protection authority which oversees eBay on the Continent because the company’s European headquarters are based in the small country.

Mr. Lommel said he met with eBay officials on Wednesday to discuss the data breach and would begin the inquiry after discussing the issue with his colleagues on Monday.

“We have a big problem here” Mr. Lommel said in an interview. “I’m a little bit astonished that no criminal use of the information has yet been detected.”

The investigation which could take several months will involve cooperation with other European regulators as well as the potential involvement of United States authorities. Officials in Illinois Florida and Connecticut are also looking into eBay’s data breach. And in New York the attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman has asked that the company provide free credit monitoring to those whose data was compromised.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Francisco is investigating the breach. The F.B.I.'s spokesman Peter D. Lee said the agency hoped to bring the criminals responsible to “swift justice” but offered no timeline for arrests.

Mr. Lommel said he had yet to contact his counterparts in the United States though he had informed other European data authorities about his plans earlier this week.

“I expect that it will be a large exercise” he said. “The investigation itself could take months but the first few weeks will be the most decisive.”

While Luxembourg’s data regulator does not have the authority to fine companies for privacy failures the European watchdog can force them to change their internal procedures to correct any data protection flaws.

It also can refer cases to the country’s public prosecutor who can bring criminal charges against companies or individuals. Those penalties could include fines totaling 125000 euros or $170000 and jail terms of up to one year. Mr. Lommel added that the case against eBay would be unlikely to lead to prison sentences.

“We have relationships with and proactively contacted a number of state federal and international regulators and law enforcement agencies” eBay said in a statement on Friday. “We are fully cooperating with them on all aspects of this incident.”

Earlier this month the European Union’s highest court ruled against Google in a decision that allowed local citizens — and possibly those outside the union — to ask the search engine to take down links to information about themselves online.

On Friday Mr. Lommel of the Luxembourg data regulator said the growth of online data would most likely lead to more privacy breaches as individuals increasingly upload personal information onto services run by some of the world’s largest tech companies.

“We will have more and more nightmares” he said. “It’s impossible to know where this will end.”"
_BREACH,May_28_2015_Five_Steps_to_Secure_Your_Data_After_I.R.S._Breach.txt,"Video

The Internal Revenue Service has been added to a long list of companies and government agencies that hackers have breached in the last year.

And so if there is any advice security experts have for those trying to keep their personal information safe it is simply: You can’t.

“Your information has already been out there for years available to anyone who wants to pay a couple dollars” Brian Krebs a security blogger who has been a frequent target of hackers said Wednesday.

The attack on the I.R.S. is just the latest evidence that hackers already have all the information necessary to steal your identity. The agency said Tuesday that hackers used information stolen from previous breaches — including Social Security numbers birth dates street addresses and passwords — to complete a multistep authentication process and request tax returns and other filings.

But consumers can make things harder for criminals. There may be a trade-off in convenience but experts say the alternative is a lot worse.

1. Turn on multifactor authentication.

If a service offers added security features like multifactor authentication turn them on. When you enter your password you will receive a message usually via text with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in.

Most banking sites and popular sites like Google Apple Twitter and Facebook offer two-factor authentication and will ask for a second one-time code anytime you log in from a new computer.

2. Change your passwords again.

Yes you need to change passwords again and they have to be passwords you have never used before. They need to be long and not words you would find in a dictionary. The first thing hackers do when trying to break into a site is use computer programs that can test every word in the dictionary.

Password managers like LastPass or Password Safe create long unique passwords for the websites you visit and store them in a database that is protected by a master password you have memorized.

It may sound counterintuitive but the truly paranoid write down their passwords.

Security experts advise creating anagrams based on song lyrics movie quotations or sayings and using symbols or numbers and alternating lower and upper cases to make the password more difficult. For instance the “Casablanca” movie quotation “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine” becomes OaTgJiAtTiAtWsWiM.

Use stronger longer passwords for sites that contain the most critical information like bank or email accounts.

3. Forget about security questions.

Sites will often use security questions such as “What was the name of your first school?” or “What is your mother’s maiden name?” to recover a user’s account if the password is forgotten.

These questions are problematic because the Internet has made public record searches a snap and the answers are usually easy to guess.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In a recent study security researchers at Google found that with a single guess an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user’s answer to the question “What is your favorite food?” (It was pizza.)

With 10 tries an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user’s answer to the question “What is your city of birth?” and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.

Jonathan Zdziarski a computer forensics expert said he often answers these questions with an alternate password. If a site offers only multiple choice answers or only requires short passwords he won’t use it.

“You can tell a lot about the security of a site just by looking at the questions they’ll ask you” he said.

4. Monitor your credit.

Typically a service will offer one year of free credit monitoring if it has been breached. But be aware that attackers do not dispose of your Social Security number birth date or password a year after they acquire it.

It is better to monitor your credit aggressively at all times through free services like AnnualCreditReport.com.

5. Freeze your credit.

In the attack at the I.R.S. a credit freeze may not have thwarted thieves from filing for false tax refunds but it could have stopped them from pulling tax transcripts or opening other accounts.

To freeze your credit call Equifax Experian or TransUnion and ask to have your account frozen. The credit agency will mail a one-time PIN or password to unfreeze your account later.

The fee to freeze and refreeze credit varies by state. If you plan on applying for a new job renting an apartment or buying insurance you will have to thaw a freeze temporarily and pay a fee to refreeze the account.

But if you have been a victim of identity theft and can show a police report proving as much most states will waive the freeze fee."

LulzSec

Lulz Security a group of hackers who have claimed responsibility for a number of recent online data breaches claimed two more victims on Monday including Bethesda Softworks a video game company and the Web site of the United States Senate.

The hackers claim that they breached Bethesda Softworks’ servers over two months ago but just released server data Monday. The group also said it has over 200000 gamer usernames and passwords that it took from the site. The group said it has not yet decided whether it will release this information to the public.

Bethesda Softworks did not respond to a request for comment about the data breach.

Lulz Security also said on Twitter that it had successfully attacked the United States Senate Web site.

In a release issued on the hacker’s Web site the group said they were releasing a “small” amount of data from senate.gov “in an attempt to help them fix their issues.” The files released are relatively harmless and only show a thin layer of internal data on the government Web site.

Martina Bradford the deputy sergeant-at-arms of the Senate said in a statement Monday that security staff at senate.gov became aware of the attacks over the weekend. The statement noted that the hackers did not infiltrate any Senate computers or the government firewall but were able to breach the public Web site’s files and file structures of its servers.

“As always we continue to work with our federal cyber security and law enforcement partners to enhance the security of federal government Web sites” the statement said. “We are also initiating a review of all the sites hosted on senate.gov urging the individuals responsible for those sites to conduct their own review and continuing to take other actions to safeguard the Senate’s public Web presence.”

Lulz Security has claimed responsibility for hacking a number of other sites and organizations over the past two months including PBS.org Sonypictures.com and an Web site associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

A press officer or the F.B.I. declined to comment about the latest attacks."
_BREACH,Oct_10_2014_Kmart_and_Dairy_Queen_Report_Data_Breach.txt,"Photo

In the latest cyberattack on American retailers and restaurants both Kmart and Dairy Queen said their computer systems were compromised in security intrusions involving customers’ credit and debit card information.

Kmart a subsidiary of Sears Holdings said on Friday that it had been breached and that it was working with law enforcement as well as a forensics team. The company said that it appeared to have been attacked in early September and that malware was present on some of its in-store payment systems. The malware like the type found at Home Depot recently was meant to evade antivirus systems.

The company did not indicate how many stores were affected or how many credit cards were potentially compromised but said the malware had been removed.

Dairy Queen also said on Thursday that its in-store payment systems contained malware. The company said it was working with its franchisees to determine if and when each location was breached and posted a full list with time frames on its website. That information suggests hackers made their way into Dairy Queen payment systems in August.

Based on early forensics reports Sears and Dairy Queen said there was no no evidence that personal information debit card PINs email addresses or Social Security numbers were obtained in the attack. Only account numbers and expiration dates were taken.

Sears and Dairy Queen join nearly a dozen retailers — including Target Sally Beauty Neiman Marcus the United Parcel Service Michaels Albertsons SuperValu P.F. Chang’s and Home Depot — that have had their in-store payment systems compromised with malware over the last year.

The Secret Service estimated this summer that 1000 American merchants were affected by this kind of attack and that many of them may not even know that they were breached. There have been no arrests to date.

In each case criminals scanned for tools that typically allow employees and vendors to work remotely then broke into those tools using their foothold to install malware on retailers’ systems. That malware in turn fed customers’ payment details back to the hackers’ computer servers.

The same group of criminals in Eastern Europe is believed to be behind the earlier attacks according to several people with knowledge of the results of forensics investigations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements.

The entry point for each breach has differed according to law enforcement officials. At Target it was thought to be a Pennsylvania company that provided heating air-conditioning and refrigeration services to the retailer. Criminals were able to use the company’s log-in credentials to gain access to Target’s systems and eventually to its point-of-sale systems.

Studies have found that retailers in particular are unprepared for such attacks. A joint study by the Ponemon Institute an independent security research firm and DB Networks a database security firm found that a majority of computer security experts in the United States believed that their organizations lacked the technology and tools to quickly detect database attacks.

Only one-third of those experts said they did the kind of continuous database monitoring needed to identify irregular activity in their databases and another 22 percent acknowledged that they did no scanning at all.

Sears said it would offer free credit-monitoring services to any customer who had used a credit or debit card at any of its affected store locations. Dairy Queen said it would offer free identity repair services for one year to affected customers."
_BREACH,Oct_23_2015_TalkTalk_hacking_crisis_deepens_as_more_details_emerge.txt,"TalkTalk is facing increasing criticism after belatedly admitting it was the victim of a “significant and sustained” cyber-attack that has led to the theft of the credit card and bank details of up to 4 million customers.

The telecoms giant warned that the stolen customer data may not have been securely encrypted and that it had received a ransom demand from someone who claimed to have carried out the corporate hack.

Related: TalkTalk breach: what to do if you're a customer

During a round of media interviews on Friday Talk Talk’s chief executive Dido Harding said: “I personally received a contact from someone purporting – as I say I don’t know whether they are or are not – to be the hacker looking for money.”

Asked by the BBC whether customers’ bank details had been encrypted by TalkTalk she said: “The awful truth is I don’t know”.

“With the benefit of hindsight were we doing enough? Well you’ve got to say that we weren’t and obviously we will be looking back and reviewing that extremely seriously.”

Customers were being advised to contact their bank and Action Fraud the national fraud and internet crime reporting centre if they noticed unusual activity on their accounts. They were also urged to change their TalkTalk account passwords and any other accounts that used the same passwords.

It is the company’s third major security breach in the past year. In December 2014 customers received India-based scam calls after the first breach. It happened again in February with TalkTalk customers being subject to further scams despite the company describing the information that was stolen in the breach as limited and non-sensitive.

The information commissioner who is already investigating the previous two security breaches criticised TalkTalk for taking more than 24 hours to tell his office what had happened. Christopher Graham told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I wish we had heard a little bit earlier and we could have been more ‘out there’ giving advice to consumers about what they need to protect their personal information.”

Harding said the firm acted as promptly as it could because it was not initially aware that a hack was taking place. “On Wednesday lunchtime all we knew was that our website was running slowly and that we had the indications of a hacker trying to attack us” she said.

Related: TalkTalk criticised for poor security and handling of hack attack

Experts said it was conducted by a denial of service (DDoS) attack.



Tim Smith partner and head of technology media and telecoms at the insurance law firm BLM said: “These types of attacks are becoming increasingly common in the UK and it is not at all unusual to find that hackers use an initial DDoS to distract a business’s IT team and then follow up with a second attack trying to steal information.



“This underlines how at risk businesses are and how important it is to take all precautionary measures to protect customer data.”

TalkTalk Mobile customers were affected by an attack on Carphone Warehouse systems in August in which the personal information of up to 2.4 million customers was stolen.

The Information Commissioner’s Office can impose monetary penalties for data breaches capped at £500000 as well as enforcement notices. While there is no specific requirement for firms to encrypt data Graham indicated that there could be a bigger penalty from the watchdog if it believed the customer information on TalkTalk’s systems was not secure.

Referring to the £250000 penalty imposed on Sony Corporation after it was found that leaked PlayStation customer data had not been encrypted he said: “People have got to take this seriously”.

Harding apologised to customers for the latest cyber-attack but said the three breaches in the past year were unrelated. TalkTalk shares closed down 4% on Friday.

Harding said the attack should be treated as a crime. “Whether it is the US government Apple [or] a host of companies cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against” she said.



The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach although there was little firm information available about the hackers.

Adrian Culley a former detective at Scotland Yard’s cybercrime unit said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamist militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.”

The claim could not be verified but Culley pointed out that a group calling itself “TalkTalk Hackers” published what it claimed was a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack.



The group posted the message on the site Pastebin which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamist militants to justify the hack saying: “We will teach our children to use the web for Allah … your hands will be covered in blood … judgment day is soon”.

Prof Peter Sommer from De Montfort University’s cybersecurity unit told the Today programme: “It seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely [though] not impossible.

“One has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt; since they have gone public I suspect that’s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information get hold of the personal information.”"

The White House published two lengthy reports on big data and privacy last Thursday. The one that got all the attention understandably was the review led by John D. Podesta a senior adviser to the White House. It was the more general report and concluded with a handful of policy recommendations including developing government limits on how companies use the vast amounts of information they collect about people.

The second report was billed as a technical assessment and was produced by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology or PCAST. The group consists of academics government scientists and industry representatives. The working group for last week’s report had a large dose of members from the big data business — Eric Schmidt executive chairman of Google; Craig Mundie senior adviser to the chief executive of Microsoft; and Mark Gorenberg head of Zetta Venture Partners which invests in data start-ups.

Privacy groups including the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy were critical of the science and technology advisers’ report for recommending that policy should focus mainly on the use of data rather than in the collection of data. Privacy advocates say that allowing companies to collect all kinds of data — from web browsing to buying habits — opens the door to abuses like discriminating against the poor older people or minorities or deploying marketing tactics that exploit them. Industry executives and others who prefer regulating the use of data say there is so much of it out there already and more all the time that trying to curb data collection is impractical and not likely to be effective. Besides they add there is a fast-growing economy fueled by data generating jobs and wealth for America.

The appropriate target for policy is a reasonable subject of debate. But I was struck by the candor and clarity on certain critical issues in the PCAST report especially given its membership. The current approach to online privacy is built around the notion that informed consumers can make reasonable choices; in legal terms it is called “notice and consent.” This concept — or myth — of the empowered consumer means individuals have to fend for themselves in the bewildering opaque arena of online privacy and marketing practices. “It fundamentally places the burden of privacy protection on the individual” the PCAST report states. “Notice and consent creates a nonlevel playing field in the implicit privacy negotiation between provider and user.”

The report went on to explain with the example of a person browsing through a website seeking information or goods to buy and being confronted with a “terms of service” page. “The provider” the report states “offers a complex take-it-leave-it set of terms while the user in practice can allocate only a few seconds to evaluating the offer. This is a kind of market failure.”

That is hardly the only way the market for online privacy is tilted against the individual. In an interview last week Mr. Podesta repeatedly used the term “asymmetry” to describe the present state of affairs in which consumers have little idea of how data about their online behavior is collected traded and analyzed or for what purposes. To simplify for the purpose of explanation: On one side of the screen is grandma looking for information on arthritis treatments and for gifts for her grandchildren while on the other side of that screen is a Ph.D. quant from Google a Silicon Valley start-up or some other company looking to maximize grandma’s value.

The answer the PCAST report suggests is to change the market shifting the responsibility for privacy. “The primary burden” the report states “must fall on the commercial user of big data and not on the consumer.”

If that occurred it would be a big change indeed. The challenge is how to make that happen. In broad strokes the answer is some combination of rules and tools.

The PCAST report surveys the recent technological progress in data tagging so-called accountable systems and automated personal profiles that contain a person’s privacy preferences. Outside groups the report states could offer competing privacy-preference profiles. The report suggested a few hypothetical examples. A profile supplied by the American Civil Liberties Union might give particular weight to individual rights while a profile offered by Consumer Reports might be weighted toward economic value for the consumer.

Technology can help the report states but it is not the whole answer. “Rules and regulations provide both deterrence of harmful actions and incentives to deploy privacy-protecting technologies” the report states. “Privacy protection cannot be achieved by technical measures alone.”

The concept of changing market incentives and responsibilities has a lot of appeal. That’s what happened in consumer finance. A few rules were set in place including a $50 limit on individual liability for fraudulent changes on a credit card that was lost or stolen. So it fell to the banking industry to make credit card fraud a small manageable problem to protect their profits. The banking industry made huge investments in computing technology to do just that. And the credit card industry flourished.

Online privacy is a different market but the principle is the same."
_DC,Jun_15_2010_States_Discuss_Joint_Inquiry_of_Google's_Data_Collection.txt,"Google’s headaches over its collection of private data from Wi-Fi networks are intensifying.

Attorneys general from about 30 states are investigating whether Google violated any laws when vehicles used by the company to snap pictures for the Street View service also collected snippets of personal information sent over unsecured wireless networks.

On Thursday attorneys general from about 30 states participated in a conference call do discuss whether to join forces.

The call was spearheaded by Richard Blumenthal Connecticut’s attorney general who was among the first to open an investigation into the data gathering by Google.

“Violating legitimate expectations of privacy on the part of both homeowners and business people is an extraordinarily serious issue and we want all the facts as quickly as possible” Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview by phone.

Mr. Blumenthal said the conference call with his counterparts “was the first step in an effort to cooperate in a possible joint investigation and action. At this point we are asking questions and frankly some of the answers we received so far have raised additional questions that we have put to the company.”

Last month Google revealed that it had collected private data like e-mails and other communications from unsecured wireless networks. Since then the company has faced a deluge of civil and criminal investigations from various European countries as well as Australia.

In the United States the matter has been subject of Congressional inquiries and class action lawsuits in various states.

Google declined to comment on individual investigations or lawsuits. But the company repeated earlier statements that its collection of data from Wi-Fi networks was a mistake but not illegal.

“This was a mistake but we don’t we believe we did anything illegal” said Christine Chen a Google spokeswoman. “We’re working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.”

Mr. Blumenthal said that about 30 states joined the conference call last week while a number of other states were interested in the issue but unable to participate in the call.

He said the states are discussing whether to pool their resources for an investigation “without knowing what action if any will be taken. The action will depend on what we find.”

On Tuesday Richard Brodsky an New York State assemblyman asked that state to conduct an investigation into whether Google violated criminal laws.

In a letter to Andrew Cuomo the New York State attorney general who is running for governor Mr. Brodsky asked for a formal investigation into whether Google violated a number of criminal laws including a statute barring unauthorized intrusions into computers or computer networks. Mr. Brodsky who authored that statute is running for state attorney general."
_DC,May_25_2015_Obama_Weighs_Strategy_as_Data_Laws_Run_Out.txt,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is weighing what the looming expiration of three counterterrorism laws — including the provision that has been cited to allow the National Security Agency to vacuum up logs of Americans’ phone calls — would mean for future operations even as officials say the “wind-down process” for the bulk calling data program has already begun.

A senior American intelligence official said Sunday that the administration had begun assessing what the rules would be for analysts to retrieve five years of Americans’ calling data previously acquired under the bulk phone logs program if Congress fails to act by June 1 and the ability to collect newly created records is lost.

Separately officials are examining whether to invoke a so-called grandfather clause for the three laws that would permit the expiring legal authority to continue after next Monday for investigations already underway.

The three laws let the government collect business records for a counterterrorism investigation continue wiretapping suspected terrorists as they shift from phone to phone in an effort to evade detection and tap “lone wolf” suspects who are not part of a broader terrorism group.

Divided by disagreements over whether to keep the bulk phone records program or replace it with something else the Senate adjourned on Saturday for a week without passing legislation addressing the expiration.

The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky has said that he will reconvene the Senate on Sunday one day before the deadline.

But it is not clear how the impasse will end given the need to secure 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to defeat a filibuster.

As things stand there are neither 60 votes to extend the existing bulk phone records program nor 60 to enact legislation known as the USA Freedom Act which would replace it with one in which the bulk records stay in the phone companies’ hands.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had given the government a deadline of last Friday to file a new application to extend the bulk phone records program for 90 days. Given the disarray in the Senate and the looming deadline the Justice Department did not file the official said speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence-related matters.

Obama administration officials said Saturday that the government was starting to take steps to shut down the bulk phone records program by the deadline. However it was not clear what preliminary steps are necessary since the program simply involves phone companies’ handing over billing records each day. Pressed to explain what the government meant by taking such steps multiple officials declined to answer.

The administration is holding to its decision not to invoke the grandfather clause to keep collecting bulk phone records past next Monday the official said. But the government has not ruled out invoking such a clause for using the business records provision — as well as the other two powers that are expiring — to gather specific records for more routine investigations.

“We will not use the grandfather clause in the Patriot Act to continue the bulk metadata collection program; it would not be tenable for us to do so” the senior official said.

“Thus because of the pending sunset of the current authority we have not filed an application with the FISA court to continue collection” the official said referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court also known as FISC.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The official added “We will consider in light of our national security needs and the status of our authorities whether to make an appropriate filing with the FISC about accessing previously collected metadata.”

While the fate of the bulk phone logs program has received the greatest attention the Justice Department separately used the expiring Patriot Act business records provision more than 160 times last year to obtain other types of business records for investigations including Internet activity logs.

It rarely uses the expiring “lone wolf” wiretapping authority but has apparently made greater use of the expiring power to get wiretaps for suspects who shift from phone to phone.

The administration is hoping to avoid any need to go to the court for permission to query already-acquired bulk phone data which would raise additional legal complications.

A federal appeals court recently ruled that the phone program was illegal because Congress did not intend the statute to permit such sweeping collections of information.

Since then the government has not asked the surveillance court to issue any rulings — like extending the program or querying a new suspicious number — avoiding for now a confrontation over the conflicting legal interpretations."
_DC,Jan_24_2003_Senate_Rejects_Pentagon_Plan_to_Mine_Citizens'_Personal_Data_for_Clues_to_Terrorism.txt,"WASHINGTON Jan. 23— The Senate voted today to bar deployment of a Pentagon project to search for terrorists by scanning information in Internet mail and in the commercial databases of health financial and travel companies here and abroad.

The curbs on the project called the Total Information Awareness Program were adopted without debate and by unanimous consent as part of a package of amendments to an omnibus spending bill. House leaders had no immediate comment on the surprise action which will almost certainly go to a House-Senate conference. Neither did the White House or the Defense Department.

Senator Ron Wyden the Oregon Democrat who proposed the amendment said after the vote that it passed so easily because dismayed Republican senators had told him that ''this is about the most far-reaching government surveillance proposal we have ever heard about.'' He said the amendment means ''there will be concrete checks on the government's ability to snoop on law-abiding Americans.''

Under the legislation passed today research and development of the system would have to halt within 60 days of enactment of the bill unless the Defense Department submitted a detailed report about the program including its costs goals impact on privacy and civil liberties and prospects for success in stopping terrorists. The research could also continue if President Bush certified to Congress that the report could not be provided or that a halt ''would endanger the national security of the United States.''

The limits on deploying or using the system are stricter. While it could be used to support lawful military and foreign intelligence operations it could not be used in this country until Congress had passed new legislation specifically authorizing its use.

The Wyden amendment also included a statement that Congress believed ''the Total Information Awareness programs should not be used to develop technologies for use in conducting intelligence activities or law enforcement activities against United States persons without appropriate consultation with Congress or without clear adherence to principle to protect civil liberty and privacy.''

The program is being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency a high-tech unit that played a major role in the creation of the Internet. It is headed by John M. Poindexter a retired rear admiral who was convicted of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra scandal but subsequently cleared on the grounds that he had been granted immunity for his testimony.

Admiral Poindexter described the program's goals in a California speech last year when he said ''we must become much more efficient and more clever in the ways we find new sources of data mine information from the new and the old generate information make it available for analysis convert it to knowledge and create actionable options.''

As soon as the existence of the project was disclosed last November it drew intense criticism from civil libertarians on the left and the right ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Free Congress Foundation and the Eagle Forum.

Tonight Ralph Neas head of People for the American Way one of the critical groups issued a statement hailing the vote. It said: ''Until today the Bush administration has proceeded unchecked in many aspects of the war on terrorism. I hope that today's action demonstrates Congress' willingness to perform oversight of the executive branch and challenge attempts to undermine constitutional liberties.''

Even without extensive debate the measure was weighed across the political spectrum of the Senate. No senator sought to block it by withholding the unanimous consent its passage required. So Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska the Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee almost casually slid it into a package of minor amendments to the spending bill.

The one Republican who had put his name on the measure as a co-sponsor Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa issued a statement afterwards saying ''Our amendment should make sure that the T.I.A. program strikes the very careful balance that is needed to protect civil liberties while at the same time protecting a Americans against terrorists.''

A Democratic co-sponsor Senator Dianne Feinstein of California struck a similar note. She issued a statement saying the measure ''fences in the program to prevent it from being abused to invade Americans' privacy and civil liberties but does so without impeding our military and intelligence efforts.''

Senator Wyden also stressed accountability saying the vote showed ''the Senate isn't going to let the program just grow without tough oversight.'' He said the reporting requirement ''puts some real pressure on them'' and ''Congress will no longer be in the dark.''"
_DC,May_20_2010_German_Prosecutors_Open_Google_Investigation.txt,"BERLIN — Prosecutors in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation against Google on Wednesday over its collection of private Internet data from unsecured home wireless networks in Germany.

The action in the city-state of Hamburg where Google’s German headquarters is located could increase pressure on the world’s largest search engine company operator to turn over one of the hard drives used in its data-gathering effort something Google has declined to do thus far.

German data protection officials on Monday set a May 26 deadline for Google to hand over one of the hard drives from the roving vehicles it used to compiled its 360-degree Street View photo mapping archive.

The investigation which will determine whether prosecutors bring criminal charges against Google employees came in response to a complaint filed Monday by Jens Ferner a law student from Alsdorf Germany. Mr. Ferner said he wanted to clarify German law regarding the collection of data from unsecured wireless area networks or WLANs.

“We are absolutely at an early stage” Wilhelm Möllers a spokesman for the Hamburg prosecutor’s office said during an interview. “This isn’t something that will be wrapped up in two or three weeks. We have to analyze whether there is reason to file criminal charges.”

Under pressure from German privacy regulators Google said Friday that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured WLANs around the world as it assembled its Street View archive. Google said the data which it has described as snippets of Web sites and the contents of personal e-mail messages was collected because of a programming error. The company has offered to destroy the data in conjunction with regulators.

Kay Oberbeck a Google spokesman in Hamburg said Wednesday that “as we have said since we made our announcement last week we are working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.”

Google so far has not agreed to turn over one of its hard drives to German for inspection. Under German law a conviction for illegal data gathering carries a 2-year prison sentence or a fine.

Mr. Möllers said it was too early to say whether prosecutors in would ask Google for one of the hard drives as part of the criminal investigation.

Johannes Caspar the Hamburg data protection supervisor who made the original request to Google to inspect one of the hard drives said he met earlier Wednesday with Google executives to discuss Street View and the improperly obtained WLAN data.

Mr. Caspar said the Google representatives did not commit to supplying one of the hard drives by the deadline next Wednesday. “But they assured me that we would have an answer to our request by then” Mr. Caspar said during an interview. “It can be that this separate criminal investigation may increase their readiness to meet our request. I don’t know.”

While accepted in Britain and France Street View has encountered resistance in Germany and Switzerland where privacy laws are stricter than in the rest of Europe and opposition to the 360-degree photo archive has been growing. The German criminal investigation is the latest in a series of privacy disputes involving the search engine in Europe.

In February three Google executives were convicted in Italian court of violating privacy laws after youths posted a video on YouTube which is owned by Google showing the harassment of an autistic boy. Google has said it will appeal the conviction. In Switzerland Google has agreed to freeze further expansion of its Street View archive in the country pending the outcome of a legal challenge by the federal data commissioner.

Street View is not yet available in Germany where thousands of residents have asked that Google exclude their homes faces and cars to the German consumer protection ministry said."
_DC,Jun_13_2012_British_Officials_Try_Again_on_Google_Data_Collection.txt,"British privacy officials may have finally decided to get to the bottom of how and why Google secretly collected personal data from potentially millions of the nation’s citizens. This week the Information Commissioner’s Office reopened its investigation. There is a big problem however; the I.C.O. permitted Google to destroy the controversial data two years ago.

“It is rather difficult for the I.C.O. to now turn the clock back or indeed prove anything” Chris Pounder a data protection expert with the training firm Amberhawk was quoted as saying in The Telegraph.

The back story: Google was forced to reveal in the spring of 2010 that its Street View mapping cars had also been scooping up information from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks in homes and businesses. As privacy investigations began around the world the company maintained that the data collection had resulted from an unauthorized project by an engineer acting on his own and that very little consequential data had been collected anyway.

In July 2010 I.C.O. officials visited Google headquarters in London and viewed a sample of the data as served up by the search engine’s technicians. Not much to it the investigators concluded: “On the basis of the samples we saw we are satisfied so far that it is unlikely that Google will have captured significant amounts of personal data.”

A second look in 2011 persuaded the investigators that sensitive personal data had indeed been obtained. But it was the Federal Communications Commission’s much more thorough examination which concluded two months ago that prompted the I.C.O. to take yet another crack at it.

“We understand that a wide range of personal data together with some sensitive data was present in the payloads including I.P. addresses full user names telephone numbers complete e-mail messages e-mail headings instant messages and their content logging in credentials medical listings and legal infractions information in relation to online dating and visits to pornographic sites and data contained in video and audio files” Steve Eckersley the I.C.O. enforcement head wrote to Google on Monday.

What really seems to have irked Mr. Eckersley was that what was originally billed as “a simple mistake” was not according to the F.C.C. quite so simple; others at Google were informed. “If the data was collected deliberately then it is clear that this is a different situation than was reported to us in April 2010” Mr. Eckersley wrote.

Google told the British media that its executives did not want the data and had never looked at it and that it would cooperate with the new inquiry.

Some experts were a bit more hopeful that the regulators could achieve a satisfactory resolution. Nick Pickles director of the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch was quoted in the Huffington Post U.K. as saying that “the investigation must now be pursued with the vigor sadly lacking in 2010 and every effort made to ensure that Google answers the extremely important questions that it has so far avoided.”

One of those questions posed by the I.C.O. on Monday: When Google showed the I.C.O. a sample of what was collected in that July 2010 visit why didn’t it include anything like the type of personal data the I.C.O. now knows was collected?"
_DC,Oct_21_2010_244000_Germans_Opt_Out_of_Google_Mapping_Service.txt,"BERLIN — Google on Thursday said 244000 people in Germany had asked the company to remove images of their houses and apartments from its Street View maps but that the requests would not derail its plans to activate the service this year.

The figure was in line with what German data protection officials had previously estimated. The officials predicted that several hundred thousand people would opt out.

In a blog posting on its Web site Google said 2.9 percent of the 8.5 million households in Germany’s 20 largest cities had opted out of the service.

“This shows that 97 percent of German households have no problem with Street View” said Kay Oberbeck a Google spokesman in Hamburg. “We have gone out of our way to make sure everyone’s concerns have been addressed.”

Mr. Oberbeck said Google had hired 200 people in Hamburg and Munich to validate and process the requests before Street View is activated. In addition to adjusting the photographic database Google has sent residents requesting the removal their houses unique PIN numbers by postal mail in an effort to verify the veracity of each request.

Google has been working to make amends with privacy regulators in Germany over Street View and over personal data that Google inadvertently obtained off unencrypted Wi-Fi routers while collecting information for the service.

Google agreed with the government last year to let Germans opt out of the service after data protection officials in the northern states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg protested the compiling of photographs of German homes.

Under its pact with German data protection officials Google is blurring the image of entire apartment buildings even if just one apartment resident has requested to be removed from the archive.

In cases in which entire apartment buildings are blurred Mr. Oberbeck said that Google would keep ground-floor businesses visible unless proprietors requested otherwise.

The concessions were the first time Google had allowed residents of any country to opt out of Street View before the service is up and running. Residents in other countries can e-mail Google to request their homes be removed but only once Street View is active. Street View will be available in 32 countries including 10 in Europe.

Mr. Oberbeck said that while Google still intended to go live with Street View this year the company did not know exactly when that would happen.

Google is working with several governments in Europe to settle investigations into the company’s collection of personal data via Wi-Fi routers.

Canada on Tuesday also said the company had violated its privacy laws by obtaining personal data from Wi-Fi routers during a Street View sweep. Google said the violation was the result of a “careless error.”

Google has consistently blamed human error for the collection of such data.

After initially balking Google in September gave German data officials a copy of the data it had mistakenly collected there. German data officials say they are evaluating the data Google provided.

_DC,Feb_12_2003_Congress_Agrees_to_Bar_Pentagon_From_Terror_Watch_of_Americans.txt,"WASHINGTON Feb. 11— House and Senate negotiators have agreed that a Pentagon project intended to detect terrorists by monitoring Internet e-mail and commercial databases for health financial and travel information cannot be used against Americans.

The conferees also agreed to restrict further research on the program without extensive consultation with Congress.

House leaders agreed with Senate fears about the threat to personal privacy in the Pentagon program known as Total Information Awareness. So they accepted a Senate provision in the omnibus spending bill passed last month said Representative Jerry Lewis the California Republican who heads the defense appropriations subcommittee.

Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania the senior Democrat on the subcommittee said of the program ''Jerry's against it and I'm against it so we kept the Senate amendment.'' Of the Pentagon he said ''They've got some crazy people over there.''

The only obstacles to the provision becoming law would be the failure of the negotiators to reach an agreement on the overall spending bill in which it is included or a successful veto by President Bush of the bill.

Lt. Cmdr. Donald Sewell a Pentagon spokesman defended the program saying ''The Department of Defense still feels that it's a tool that can be used to alert us to terrorist acts before they occur.'' He said ''It's not a program that snoops into American citizens' privacy.''

One important factor in the breadth of the opposition is the fact that the research project is headed by Adm. John M. Poindexter. Several members of Congress have said that the admiral was an unwelcome symbol because he had been convicted of lying to Congress about weapons sales to Iran and illegal aid to Nicaraguan rebels an issue with constitutional ramifications the Iran-contra affair. The fact that his conviction was later reversed on the ground that he had been given immunity for the testimony in which he lied did not mitigate Congressional opinion they said.

The negotiators' decision was praised by Democrats and Republicans and by outside groups on the right and the left. Senator Ron Wyden the Oregon Democrat who sponsored the Senate amendment said ''It looks like Congress is getting the message from the American people loud and clear and that is: Stop the trifling of the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans.''

Senator Charles E. Grassley the Iowa Republican who co-sponsored the Wyden amendment said: ''Protecting Americans' civil liberties while at the same time winning the war against terrorism has got to be top priority for the United States. Congressional oversight of this program will be a must as we proceed in the war against terror. The acceptance of this amendment sends a signal that Congress won't sit on its hands as the TIA program moves forward.''

Lisa Dean director of the Center for Technology at the Free Congress Foundation said ''I am thrilled to see Congress taking responsibility in oversight given the depth of the debate on this issue.''

Katie Corrigan legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union said: ''This is a positive first step toward protecting the privacy of Americans. Congress represents the people's interests and appropriately responded to broad public concern about a program that does not reflect the goals of making us both safe and free.''

The negotiators' decision meant almost complete failure for a last-minute Pentagon effort begun Friday to protect the program from the Wyden amendment by establishing advisory committees to oversee the program.

The total information concept would enable a team of intelligence analysts to gather and view information from databases pursue links between individuals and groups respond to automatic alerts and share information all from their individual computers. It could link such different electronic sources as video feeds from airport surveillance cameras credit card transactions airline reservations and records of telephone calls. The data would be filtered through software that would constantly seek suspicious patterns.

The Defense Department had already begun to discuss the use of the system with the F.B.I. and perhaps other agencies. Now without a new law specifically authorizing its use and a new specific appropriation to pay for it the program could not be used against United States citizens. But it could be employed in support of lawful military operations outside the United States and lawful foreign intelligence operations conducted wholly against non-United States citizens.

The negotiators did agree to extend from 60 to 90 days the time the Defense Department would have to provide a detailed report to Congress including its costs goals impact on privacy and civil liberties and prospects for successes against terrorists. Unless that report was filed all further research on the project would have to stop immediately. But President Bush could keep the research alive by certifying to Congress that a halt ''would endanger the national security of the United States.''

Senator Wyden's curb on the program slid through the Senate with no overt opposition and among the House-Senate negotiators it has found no vocal opposition either making it an almost incidental decision in a conference fighting over billions of dollars for thousands of programs.

Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said today ''If there is one thing that should unite everybody from the very conservative member to the very liberal member it is a concern that our own government should not spy on law-abiding citizens.''

Publicly most of the criticism of Total Information Awareness has come from Democrats. Except for Senator Grassley Republicans have been silent in public unwilling to attack a project of a Republican administration. But as Senator Wyden noted today no one from either party has been ready to speak up in its favor."

Re “In Surveillance Debate White House Turns Its Focus to Silicon Valley” (news analysis May 3):

While it may appear that the new White House report on “Big Data” places a critical spotlight on Silicon Valley online businesses know that they have little to fear. The Obama administration has largely given a green light to American digital data companies to collect our information without any serious consequences.

It’s been more than two years since the president called for the enactment of privacy legislation but he has failed to propose even a draft bill. Instead the White House has backed a lobbyist-dominated proceeding at the Commerce Department intended to develop ineffective self-regulatory privacy “codes of conduct.”

The Podesta report fails to acknowledge that a powerful commercial surveillance system has been put in place that tracks Americans online and off. It’s largely a love letter to one of the few American industries in which the United States is still a market leader: pervasive personalized data gathering.

_DC,Jun_14_1999_Aboard_Advanced_Radar_Flight_U.S._Watches_Combat_Zone.txt,"ABOARD THE JSTARS SURVEILLANCE PLANE OVER ALBANIA June 12— Almost as soon as their battery of radar screens locked onto Kosovo shortly after dawn it was obvious to everybody here that the Yugoslav forces were on the run.

The monitors told the story in Technicolor: a stream of magenta and yellow dots -- representing vehicles ranging from tractors and trucks to tanks -- inched along Highway 17 and Highway 11 through the Kosovo capital Pristina and north toward the province's border with the rest of Serbia the main republic in Yugoslavia.

Both roads are NATO-approved retreat routes for the Yugoslav forces but they had been almost empty just two days ago.

Today as NATO troops moved into Kosovo for the first time the team of Air Force and Army technicians watched the minute-by-minute progress of convoys that stretched as long as 20 miles.

''This is like day and night'' said Indy one of this flight's two senior directors who like other crew members would identify himself only by his nickname. He studied some of the 18 computer screens on this rebuilt Boeing 707. ''If we had seen this the last time we would have sent aircraft in immediately. It would have been a turkey shoot.''

This aging airplane carries the United States Air Force's newest and most advanced system for watching enemy troops from the air. The system has assumed a key role in picking targets and monitoring the peace agreement.

There are clear limits to how much can actually be seen from this distance. The radar system tries to distinguish between tanks and ordinary trucks but its guesses are often incorrect.

The men and women in this plane are miles from the combat zone generally out of range of missile attacks and protected by a shield of fighter jets. Yet as they crouched before their screens in the darkened fuselage they followed the humblest movement on the ground with an almost haunting degree of intimacy.

They scrutinized a small caravan of trucks that had wandered off the main highway. They zoomed in on the areas where Serbian forces are allowed to congregate before leaving. They watched as NATO vehicles moved north from neighboring Macedonia.

''This is information warfare'' said Kujo the flight's other senior director. ''The key to success for troops on the ground has always been the ability to look over the next hill and this takes it to a new level.''

Though used experimentally during the Persian Gulf war the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Systems are still so new that the Air Force and Army have only four of them worldwide -- two of them now in the Balkans.

Unlike its better-known predecessor the Airborne Warning and Control System or Awacs this system was designed to scrutinize events on the ground over a wide geographic area.

The radar aboard this plane housed in a canoe-shaped hull on the bottom of the fuselage can see all of Kosovo in one view. It can also zoom in on scores of small patches simultaneously serving up images demanded by the on-board technicians as well as requests from commanders at the Combined Air Operations Center in Vicenza Italy.

The Jstar planes fly some of the longest missions of any aircraft used in the Balkans. A typical flight lasts more than 17 hours and the longest mission so far lasted 21 hours. All flights require two mid-air refuelings as well as back-up pilots and crew members. Takeoff is usually before dawn from Rhine-Main Air Force Base in Frankfurt. Given the preparation beforehand and the debriefings afterward crew members routinely work 24 hours straight.

Once in position they transmit not only images but analytical reports all day long. Ken a burly technician sitting next to the senior leader banged out hourly reports describing scores of activities along all the Serbs' approved ''egress routes.''

In the very rear of the plane a small group of Army technicians ran their searches on behalf of ground forces in Macedonia. Specially-equipped Humvees allow Army units to receive the full stream of Jstar images and radar mapping and to convey information requests to the plane.

Though the dramatic movements back toward northern Yugoslavia were today's big news much of the effort here was to spot unusual or quirky behavior that might be a tip-off to unexpected problems.

That was why Indy had locked the system onto a curious parade of trucks nine big ones and six small ones that were traveling well wide of the authorized road between Prizren and Pristina.

Though heading parallel to the approved road it was wandering suspiciously. Indy instructed the system to take a close look every few seconds.

''It's easy to watch the main roads'' said Indy. ''But really good surveillance I think comes from looking for things that don't seem quite right.''

Like many weapons in this war the Jstar missions embody a curious blend of extremely advanced technology mounted on almost shockingly old equipment.

To save money the Pentagon decided to build the Jstars surveillance system into 35-year-old Boeing 707's. This one Kujo said had been a cargo plane for the Australian airline Qantas.

Air Force officials say this decision made good sense because the 707's remain reliable workhorses.

The system including the plane cost about $250 million officials said but one commander on the ground said ''Buy a radar and get the plane for free.''

But the creakiness of this plane became apparent. Fumes probably from the plane's overloaded air-conditioning system required the entire crew to strap on oxygen masks twice today. To solve the problem the aircraft commander shut off all extra electricity for the last hour of the flight.

''The real heroes in this are the maintenance guys'' a crew member said.

Despite the headaches the Jstar has become immensely popular with NATO commanders and even with fighter pilots who were once dubious about accepting guidance from it.

''When the war started people didn't know quite what to do with us'' said Indy. ''But after they started getting our flow of data they wanted more and more sorties. The biggest problem now is that we can't fill all the demand.''

BERLIN — A German privacy regulator fined Google €145000 on Monday for the systematic illegal collection of personal data while it was creating the Street View mapping service and called on European lawmakers to significantly raise fines for violations of data protection laws.

Johannes Caspar the data protection supervisor in Hamburg said the fine which was close to the maximum of €150000 or $195000 that he could legally impose was woefully inadequate to stop the collection practices of companies as large as Google.

The fine levied by Mr. Caspar the largest assessed so far by European regulators over privacy concerns amounts to roughly 0.002 percent of Google’s $10.7 billion in net profit last year.

“As long as violations of data protection law are penalized with such insignificant sums the ability of existing laws to protect personal privacy in the digital world with its high potential for abuse is barely possible” Mr. Caspar said.

In 2010 Mr. Caspar’s agency became the first to uncover Google’s collection of data from Wi-Fi routers in Germany and the company acknowledged that it had also collected data in a similar fashion for Street View around the world prompting an uproar from Washington to Hong Kong.

Google characterized the collection as inadvertent and the result of a programmer’s error. Fragments of personal e-mails photographs and other unencrypted digital data were collected by Google’s fleet of Street View automobiles as they compiled panoramic maps covering about five million miles or eight million kilometers of roadway in 49 countries.

Peter Fleischer Google’s global privacy counsel reiterated the company’s regrets and said it had taken internal steps to make sure the violations were not repeated.

“We work hard to get privacy right at Google” Mr. Fleischer said in a statement. “But in this case we didn’t which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue.”

The Google project leaders had inadvertently collected the data he said. “We never wanted this data and didn’t use it or even look at it” Mr. Fleischer said adding that the company had “cooperated fully” with Hamburg data protection officials on the investigation.

Google said it would not appeal the fine.

Anna Fielder a trustee at Privacy International a group based in London that supports strong data protection laws said the existing legal regimes in Europe and much of the world were ill equipped to meet the challenges of protecting personal information.

“Germany has the strongest data protection laws in Europe and this is all they could do” Ms. Fielder said. “Most businesses are not complying with data protection laws because the costs of noncompliance — I mean these tiny penalties — are so low.”

Google’s disclosure that it had collected the private information set off a series of investigations by regulators around the world the majority of which were settled by Google with a simple apology or with fines that were considered trivial for the world’s biggest Internet search company.

In March Google agreed to pay a fine of $7 million and to aggressively police its own employees on privacy issues to settle a lawsuit brought by 38 U.S. states. In Europe Ireland and Britain dropped their inquiries and did not impose fines after Google agreed to delete data illegally collected in their countries.

The French regulator the National Commission on Computing and Liberty fined Google €100000 in 2011. The lone criminal investigation to result from the incident initiated by the state prosecutor in Hamburg was closed without charges being brought last year.

Privacy law is enforced at the national level in the European Union. The top E.U. privacy body the Article 29 working group is an advisory committee to the European Commission and does not have the legal power to levy fines.

Mr. Caspar the Hamburg privacy regulator called on European lawmakers who are considering revisions to the main data protection law for the Union to allow for fines of up to 2 percent of a company’s annual sales. Based on Google’s revenue last year the maximum fine would have been $1 billion.

Mr. Caspar described the proposed 2 percent penalty for data protection violations as “economically significant.” European lawmakers are not expected to complete their deliberations on the privacy revisions until next year at the earliest.

The European Parliament’s lead committee considering the legislation the Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs Committee is to vote on the bill in late May but may be forced to postpone action. Lawmakers have proposed more than 3000 amendments many of which would weaken or eliminate its main provisions.

“I have never seen this magnitude of lobbying before on an issue before the Parliament” said Ms. Fielder the Privacy International official who is following the legislation for her organization.

The support of the Union’s 27 nations which are represented on the Council of Ministers a second Brussels body that functions as an upper house in the legislative process will also be key to passage of new data protection legislation.

But in the upper chamber too lobbying against the measure has been intense. The British government whose administration favors a light-touch regulatory regime attempted during the council’s early discussions this year to downgrade the data protection revisions to a voluntary recommendation.

But the British were rebuffed by German French and other Continental governments favoring stricter controls according to a copy of meeting protocols obtained by the International Herald Tribune. The British government has continued to lobby Ms. Fielder said to limit the scope of the legislation.

European Parliament lawmakers face re-election next May and if they do not pass revisions before then backers of the legislation will probably have to return to the drawing board Ms. Fielder said.

“That could set back the entire issue for years” she said."
_DC,Jun__8_2013_Congress_Can_Stop_Privacy_Abuse.txt,"Over the last three years several measures were introduced in Congress that would have helped reduce or eliminate the abuses of communications surveillance revealed this week. Every one of them was voted down.

Most members of Congress it turns out had received the usual bland assurances from counterterrorism officials that the authority granted to the government under the Patriot Act and related laws were absolutely necessary to prevent an attack on the United States and that domestic spying activities must remain top secret. Proposals to bring greater transparency to these activities or to limit their scope were vigorously opposed by the Obama administration. (The Justice Department argued in a court filing in April that there must be no public disclosure of the extent of domestic data collection.)

Except for a few leaders and members of the intelligence committees most lawmakers did not know the government was collecting records on almost every phone call made in the United States or was able to collect anyone’s e-mail messages and Internet chats. And most important since the public did not know about the extent of the surveillance it was in no position to bring popular pressure against elected representatives.

But now we know. It may be that only a small portion of domestic intelligence gathering has come to light but this week’s revelations provided a chilling glimpse of what President Obama’s National Security Agency has been up to. We now know what Senator Mark Udall of Colorado was talking about when he warned in 2011 that the “intelligence community can target individuals who have no connection to terrorist organizations.” He added “They can collect business records on law-abiding Americans” though he was prevented by legal constraints as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence from explaining that meant records on every single call.

Now that this practice has been disclosed it’s time for Congress to take action. The first step has to be ending the secrecy that makes it impossible for lawmakers or other officials to discuss even in general terms what the government is doing.

Last December Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon introduced a measure that would require the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to make public the summaries of its opinions on domestic spying activities. The measure did not pass but afterward Senator Dianne Feinstein of California the Intelligence Committee chairwoman wrote a letter to the court with Mr. Merkley Mr. Udall and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon asking it to provide such summaries. The presiding judge Reggie Walton wrote back saying that summaries could result in confusion and reveal too much information. Congress should override this resistance and require the court to be more public about its decisions.

The second step is legislation to limit the collection of call records and the monitoring of Internet traffic to that of people suspected of terrorism ending the mass warehousing of everyone’s data. Officials have never demonstrated that mining all calls and messages really prevents terrorism and the cost in lost privacy for all citizens is far too high. A bill proposed last year by Mr. Merkley and Mr. Wyden would ban the secret court from approving the collection of data unless it is clearly linked to terrorism. To preserve the nation’s civil liberties the bill should be reintroduced and passed right away."
_DC,Sep_13_2012_Big_Data_Gets_Its_Own_Photo_Album.txt,"Rick Smolan the photographer and impresario of media projects has tackled all sorts of big subjects over the years from countries (“A Day in the Life of Australia” in 1981) to drinking water (“Blue Planet Run” in 2007). He typically recruits about 100 photographers for each and their work is crafted into classy coffee-table books of striking photographs and short essays.

But Mr. Smolan concedes that his current venture has been “by far the most challenging project we’ve done.”

Small wonder given his target: Big Data.

Jason Grow/The Human Face of Big Data

Massive rivers of digital information are a snooze visually. Yet that is the narrow literal-minded view. Mr. Smolan’s new project “The Human Face of Big Data” which is being formally announced on Thursday focuses on how data smart software sensors and computing are opening the door to all sorts of new uses in science business health energy and water conservation. And the pictures are mostly of the people doing that work or those being affected.

In these digital times the book is only one part of the Big Data project. Later this month on Sept. 25 a software application for iPhones and Android phones will be released. The idea is to get as many people from around the world as possible to use the application.

The program will be able to collect data on travel and movement (through the smartphone’s GPS and accelerometer) food (take a picture and shortly after the program identifies the food including estimates of calories and fat content) and attitudes (the user answers questions posed by the app). The data will be fed into a “Measure Our World” database and people can see how their habits and attitudes compare with others by say where a person lives gender and age.

Later on Nov. 8 a Big Data-related program for students in collaboration with TEDYouth will get under way. When the book is released on Nov. 20 some 10000 copies will be delivered by Federal Express to influential people around the world Mr. Smolan said. It’s an eclectic group including President Obama; Carmelita Jeter the Olympic sprinter; Anna Wintour editor of Vogue; Sonia Gandhi president of the Indian National Congress; and Jiang Jiemin chairman of PetroChina. For the less influential who are not getting free copies the price will be $50 with a portion of the proceeds going to charity.

An iPad application based on the book but including interactive features will come soon after. And a documentary film scheduled for next year is planned.

Mr. Smolan said he got interested in doing a Big Data project because friends in Silicon Valley were talking about the growing abundance of Internet-era data and its potential. At first he said such conversations struck him as “hot air and buzzwords.” But the more he listened the more he became convinced something significant was happening. “It reminded me of the early days of the Internet” Mr. Smolan said. “Cyberspace was the buzzword then. But soon you started to see that things were taking off.”

Big Data technology Mr. Smolan said makes it possible to measure things as never before in real time. The result he said could someday be a “planetary nervous system.” And guesswork and projections will give way to knowledge and better decisions and policy-making. Low-cost sensors real-time data collection high-speed processing and data-visualization tools he said might mean “people could not deny global warming because you could see it happening right in front of you on the screen.”

Peter Menzel/The Human Face of Big Data

Mr. Smolan visited recently to offer a glimpse of what will be in “The Human Face of Big Data” and the imaginative photo composition involved in bringing technical subjects to life. One photograph shows Shwetak Patel an assistant professor at the University of Washington who has developed technology that measures energy and water use in homes; with wireless sensors and clever software to determine what appliances and gadgets in a home use the most electricity and water the software suggests ways to conserve — information delivered graphically on an iPad. The photo shows young Mr. Patel in the backyard of his cousin’s house in Hayward Calif. with his cousin’s family surrounded by what looks to be every single appliance digital device faucet and toilet in the household.

Another photo illustrates software technology that captures previously discarded data from heart-monitoring electrocardiogram machines. The software program sifts the data looking for subtle heart abnormalities that identify patients that are at high risk of suffering a second heart attack within a year. The photo shows two M.I.T. scientists John Guttag and Collin Stultz who developed the technology standing in a small mountain of paper which is 10 hours of printout data from an E.K.G. machine.

Michael Cogliantry/The Human Face of Big Data

Still another photo accompanies an essay by A.J. Jacobs an author and journalist who enlisted all kinds of sensors including Fitbit for movement and Zeo Sleep Manager in pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. “I crave maximum data about myself” Mr. Jacobs writes. “I am a quantification fiend.” Mr. Jacobs has already written a book on his quest “Drop Dead Healthy” published earlier this year. His picture which also appears on the inside cover his book shows Mr. Jacobs sporting his devices and other visual props holding a barbell in one hand and a head of broccoli in the other.

EMC the data storage giant is the main sponsor of “The Human Face of Big Data.” Jeremy Burton EMC’s chief marketing officer first met Mr. Smolan more than a year ago. The introduction came from an EMC board member and Mr. Burton agreed to meet Mr. Smolan for coffee for a half-hour in Burlingame Calif. Mr. Burton figured the obligatory meeting would soon be over but it lasted two and a half hours — “the longest cup of coffee I’ve ever had” he said.

EMC is in the business of Big Data. And Mr. Smolan’s approach seemed original and appealing to Mr. Burton. “Let’s face it most of the discussion of Big Data is a geekfest — people talking about Hadoop and other technical tools” Mr. Burton said. “Rick Smolan wanted to focus on how Big Data is affecting humanity.”

Typically Mr. Smolan tries to line up a handful of sponsors for his projects. But Mr. Burton decided that EMC would be almost the sole backer of the project (FedEx is contributing the delivery of the 10000 books on the publication day).

EMC Mr. Burton said had no editorial control and the cost was “a big chunk of change” a multimillion-dollar expenditure. “It is a risk but the elements of the project from the book to the iPad application seem really cool” he said. “And we’ll get the halo effect.”"
_DC,Dec_17_1998_Surveillance_and_Safety.txt,"To the Editor:

While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has defended the growth of video surveillance in New York City (news article Dec. 14) the New York Civil Liberties Union has recommended that these cameras be regulated.

Oddly the Mayor and the civil liberties union have the same goal: to sustain an environment that encourages people to use the streets. However neither side has addressed the underlying problems and responsibilities.

Theoretically the awareness of cameras fosters a sense of safety by making public spaces inviting for social life but there are no data to support that contention. Indeed it could be argued that the presence of the camera discourages social uses of public spaces and has significant consequences for the way our streets will be used.

_DC,Jun_12_2001_Justices_Say_Warrant_Is_Required_In_High-Tech_Searches_of_Homes.txt,"Correction Appended

WASHINGTON June 11— In an important declaration of the constitutional limits on new privacy-threatening technology the Supreme Court ruled today that the use by the police of a thermal imaging device to detect patterns of heat coming from a private home is a search that requires a warrant.

The court said further that the warrant requirement would apply not only to the relatively crude device at issue but also to any ''more sophisticated systems'' in use or in development that let the police gain knowledge that in the past would have been impossible without a physical entry into the home.

''We must take the long view from the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment forward'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a 5-to-4 majority that cut across the court's usual ideological division. [Excerpts Page A29.]

Justice Scalia said that to take any other approach ''would leave the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology -- including imaging technology that could discern all human activity in the home.''

The decision overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco -- often regarded as the most liberal of the federal appeals courts -- which held in 1999 that the warrantless use of a device that revealed patterns of heat suggestive of an indoor marijuana-growing operation did not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches.

In a dissenting opinion today Justice John Paul Stevens -- who in turn is usually described as the court's most liberal justice -- said the Ninth Circuit was correct and that the police activity in the case ''did not invade any constitutionally protected interest in privacy.'' He said that for the court today to make a constitutional rule about future technology was ''unnecessary unwise and inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.''

Those who joined Justice Scalia in the majority were Justices David H. Souter Clarence Thomas Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the dissent as did Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.

The case Kyllo v. United States No. 99-8508 was a federal drug prosecution that began in 1992 when two federal agents trained a device called Agema Thermovision 210 on a home in Florence Ore. where on the basis of tips and utility bills they believed marijuana was being grown under high-intensity lamps. While the imager cannot see through walls it can detect hot spots and in this case disclosed that part of the roof and a side wall were warmer than the rest of the building and the neighboring houses.

The agents used that information to get a warrant to enter and search the home where they found more than 100 marijuana plants growing under halide lights. The resident Danny Kyllo entered a conditional guilty plea while continuing to contest the validity of the search. He served one month in jail.

When Mr. Kyllo's Supreme Court appeal was argued in February the government strongly defended use of thermal imagers on the ground that in detecting heat loss the devices neither reveal private information nor violate the ''reasonable expectation of privacy'' that is the Supreme Court's test under the Fourth Amendment.

But in the home Justice Scalia said today ''all details are intimate details because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes.'' Noting that the court's precedents draw ''a firm line at the entrance to the house'' he added ''That line we think must be not only firm but also bright.''

Despite its forceful language the decision was undoubtedly not the court's final word on the subject of privacy and technology. Justice Scalia's emphasis on the home raised the prospect that warrantless imaging of other locations might be upheld. And it is far from clear under the court's precedents that a person in a home that belonged to someone else would have standing to challenge the use of an imager.

Further the majority limited its holding to devices that are ''not in general public use'' without explaining that limitation. In his dissenting opinion Justice Stevens said this limitation was ''somewhat perverse because it seems likely that the threat to privacy will grow rather than recede as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.''

Nonetheless the decision was important and ''surprisingly broad'' said James J. Tomkovicz a law professor at the University of Iowa who filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union.

''It was important for the court to say that there are general limits on the ability of technological developments to erode Fourth Amendment privacy'' he said in an interview.

The vote today underscored the unpredictable if not incoherent nature of the court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment currently an extremely active area of the court's jurisdiction. Last year for example the court ruled that police officers had conducted an unconstitutional search when they walked down the aisle of a long-distance bus and squeezed passengers' overhead luggage to look for contraband. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the 7-to-2 opinion in that case Bond v. United States while Justices Scalia and Breyer dissented.

On display today was Justice Scalia's insistence that the Fourth Amendment be interpreted according to the understanding of its framers.

Requiring a warrant to use technology that displaces an old-fashioned search ''assures preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted'' Justice Scalia said.

For Justice Stevens on the other hand the problem with the majority opinion appeared to be its sweeping nature.

In crafting ''an all-encompassing rule for the future'' Justice Stevens said the court ''has unfortunately failed to heed the tried and true counsel of judicial restraint.'' He added ''It would be far wiser to give legislators an unimpeded opportunity to grapple with these emerging issues rather than to shackle them with prematurely devised constitutional constraints.''

_DC,May__4_2011_Google's_South_Korean_Offices_Raided_Over_Data_Collection.txt,"SEOUL — The Seoul police raided Google’s office here Tuesday on suspicion that its mobile advertising unit AdMob had illegally collected users’ location data without users’ consent the police said. The raid represents the latest setback to the U.S. Internet search company’s South Korean operations.

The investigation also highlights growing concerns about possible misuse of private information as the popularity of mobile devices like smartphones and tablet computers increases.

Information on users’ locations is viewed as crucial for the growing mobile advertising sector as it helps personalize online ads according to individual preferences or geographical positions. Last month Apple defended its use of iPhone location data but denied that it was tracking the movements of customers.

Google and Apple have been criticized by U.S. lawmakers over their protection and use of consumer data from cellphone applications including where users are located.

Google executives have talked about the ability to tailor advertising to users on the basis of location. Google bought AdMob a leading global mobile advertising firm last year for $750 million.

“Every technology has a flip side” said Kim Kwang-jo a computer science professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. “Location-based services benefit customers by helping them find nearby restaurants gas stations and other places with their smartphones. But it could potentially violate consumer privacy. There are loopholes in location-based services and companies should get consent from customers to collect location data.”

Google confirmed that the police had visited its Seoul office and said the company was cooperating with the investigation.

Jang Byung-duk who is in charge of cybercrime investigation at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said “We suspect AdMob collected personal location information without consent or approval from the Korean Communication Commission.”

The Seoul police also raided the offices of the local Internet portal Daum Communications on similar suspicions Daum said Tuesday. Daum said the collection of location data by its mobile ad services was not illegal as the data were anonymous and could not be used to track individuals.

Google has already been the subject of investigations in the United States Britain France Singapore Switzerland and South Korea over data collected for its Street View mapping service using a fleet of cars that take pictures and gather information about wireless Internet connections.

The Seoul police concluded in January that Google had collected location information and other data from 600000 wireless Internet users in South Korea with three Street View cars.

Google tightened its privacy policy after revelations that the cars which take panoramic pictures of city streets had inadvertently collected data from unsecured wireless networks in more than 30 countries.

The top Internet portals in South Korea — one of the world’s most wired countries — filed a complaint with antitrust regulators last month claiming that Google was unfairly stifling competition in the country.

Google is one of the smallest players in South Korea’s fixed-line Internet search market but it enjoys a share of nearly 20 percent in the mobile Internet market backed by its Android operating system for cellphones.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also considering a broad investigation into Google because of its dominance of the Internet search industry.

Google which controls about two-thirds of the global search market is a stellar performer in the booming smartphone and tablet market. Device makers like Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics both based in South Korea increasingly are adopting Android to counter the heavyweight Apple.

Rival technology companies including Microsoft are trying to rein in Google’s growth. The global smartphone market is forecast to grow 58 percent this year and Android-based devices will account for 39 percent of the market according to the research firm Gartner. In the tablet market Gartner said Apple’s share will gradually decline to 47 percent by 2015 from 69 percent this year with Google’s share forecast to rise to 39 percent from 20 percent now."
_DC,May__1_2003_On_the_Trail_of_the_Invisible_Leak.txt,"HOMEOWNERS who want to track the energy consumed by their appliances and electronic devices can turn to a new generation of compact digital power meters. The results may be surprising.

''My biggest oh-my-god moment was discovering that my cable box didn't use any less power even after I turned it off'' said Mike Morton the owner of a solar-powered home near Honolulu. The reading was 15 watts when on and 14.9 watts when off.

Mr. Morton said he had taken power readings for ''almost everything in the house that has a two- or three-prong plug'' in the hope of keeping his home's energy consumption below the level produced by his photovoltaic panels.

Because of the high cost of electricity in California and some other states a digital power meter may pay for itself in electricity savings. An older refrigerator may use so much electricity for example that it would be less expensive over time to replace it with a more efficient model.

The meters offer constant surveillance measuring the power being consumed at the moment or over a period of time. A television for example might draw as much as 300 watts while turned on and between 5 to 15 watts while off. Brad Volin the president of Electronic Education Devices a Denver company that manufactures power meters said that some appliance stores allowed customers to borrow a meter to compare the energy consumption of their appliances. ''Our software will show their usage and let them graph it out with a payback calculator'' to show long-term savings he said.

Electronic Education Devices sells the Watts Up Pro which can record power use over time; the data can be exported to a computer. It costs $130.95 at the company's Web site www.doubleed.com. Another company P3 International based in New York makes a smaller meter the Kill A Watt which costs $35 to $50; usage is indicated on a compact display. Information is at www.p3international.com.

_DC,Apr_15_2012_Google_Is_Faulted_for_Impeding_U.S._Inquiry_on_Data_Collection.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Google first revealed in 2010 that cars it was using to map streets were also sweeping up sensitive personal information from wireless home networks it called the data collection a mistake. On Saturday federal regulators charged that Google had “deliberately impeded and delayed” an investigation into the data collection and ordered a $25000 fine on the search giant.

The finding by the Federal Communications Commission and the exasperated tone of the report were in marked contrast to the resolution of a separate inquiry two years ago. That investigation by the Federal Trade Commission accepted Google’s explanation that it was “mortified by what happened” while collecting information for its Street View project and its promise to impose internal controls.

But since then the F.C.C. said Google repeatedly failed to respond to requests for e-mails and other information and refused to identify the employees involved.

“Although a world leader in digital search capability Google took the position that searching its employees’ e-mail ‘would be a time-consuming and burdensome task’ ” the report said. The commission also noted that Google stymied its efforts to learn more about the data collection because its main architect an engineer who was not identified had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

When the commission asked Google to identify those responsible for the program Google “unilaterally determined that to do so would ‘serve no useful purpose’ ” according to the F.C.C. report.

The data collection which took place over three years was legal because the information was not encrypted the F.C.C. ultimately determined.

A Google spokeswoman said Saturday that “we worked in good faith to answer the F.C.C.’s questions throughout the inquiry and we’re pleased that they have concluded that we complied with the law.”

Google still has the data which it said it has never looked at and has never used in its products or services. It said it intended to delete the information once regulators gave it permission. A spokeswoman did not immediately return an e-mail inquiry about whether the engineer on the project still worked for the company.

While Google’s original intentions and actions with the project are still unclear the commission’s report and fine are likely to energize an ongoing debate about Internet privacy.

The more companies like Google and Facebook know about their users the more attractive they are to advertisers which drive the vast majority of their income. Google’s introduction last month of a new privacy policy — one that allows more comprehensive tracking of its users’ actions — provoked a firestorm of criticism.

That was only the latest privacy imbroglio the company found itself in the middle of. Some politicians are becoming skeptical. Senator Al Franken a Democrat of Minnesota who is in charge of a subcommittee on privacy said in a recent speech that companies like Google and Facebook accumulated data on users because “it’s their whole business model.”

“And you are not their client; you are their product” he added.

Earlier controversies generally focused on information that users willingly provided. With its Street View project Google was taking data from people who did not even know that the company was literally outside the door peering in.

European and Canadian regulators who have examined the data Google collected in the project in their own countries found that it included complete e-mail messages instant messages chat sessions conversations between lovers and Web addresses revealing sexual orientation information that could be linked to specific street addresses.

When Google was repeatedly asked if it had searched for all responsive documents and provided complete and accurate answers to all the F.C.C.’s questions it declined to respond Michele Ellison chief of the F.C.C.’s Enforcement Bureau said in an interview.

Google ultimately provided the information requested under threat of subpoena.

The F.C.C. orders fines on companies for impeding investigations about once a year. The commission found that Google had violated provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Of the $25000 penalty Ms. Ellison said “It’s an appropriate fine based on evidence that the investigation was deliberately impeded and our precedent.” Google which for the last year has been run by Larry Page one of its founders reported net income of $2.89 billion in the first quarter of 2012.

Scrutiny of Google’s privacy policies is more intense in Europe where the Street View issue first emerged than it is in the United States. Last year for example France fined the company 100000 euros or about $140000 at the time for Street View privacy violations.

What Google was gathering as its cars drove up and down many thousands of streets is technically called payload data which simply means the content of Internet communications including e-mail. On April 27 2010 responding to rumors about its Street View project Google said it “does not collect or store payload data.”

Two weeks later it acknowledged that was “incorrect” saying “It’s now clear we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data.” In October 2010 it acknowledged that the data was more than fragments.

Google’s response to the inquiry puzzled some experts.

“If it really was a mistake you would expect the company to do everything possible to cooperate with the investigation” said Danny Sullivan of the blog Search Engine Land. “On the upside it’s reassuring that the F.C.C. itself believes Google had no plans to use the information.”

The F.C.C. did not examine the actual data that Google collected but its report quotes the investigation by the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes the French data privacy regulator as finding for example e-mails between married individuals seeking to have an affair. First names e-mail addresses and physical addresses could all be discerned.

After reviewing all the information it could get from Google the F.C.C. said it could not find a clear precedent to take enforcement action on the data collection. But then it said it still had “significant factual questions” about what really happened with the data and why it was collected in the first place."
_DC,Dec_19_2013_Turn_Off_the_Data_Vacuum.txt,"In the days after one of the biggest national security leaks in United States history revealed the existence of vast largely unchecked government surveillance programs President Obama said he would “welcome” a robust national debate over the appropriate balance between protecting national security and respecting individual privacy and civil liberties.

The answer has now landed squarely on Mr. Obama’s desk with the release late Wednesday afternoon of a remarkably thorough and well-reasoned report calling on the government to end its bulk phone-data collection program and to increase both the transparency and accountability of surveillance programs going forward.

The 300-plus-page report was written by a five-member advisory panel of intelligence and legal experts that was commissioned by the president himself and made 46 recommendations for reform. The recommendations demonstrate how far afield the National Security Agency has wandered in its zeal to vacuum up the phone and Internet data of virtually every American not to mention world leaders and other non-American citizens.

They also show the lack of regard for the Constitution that has led those efforts and the virtual absence of supervision and restraint by Mr. Obama and his predecessor President George W. Bush.

The most far-reaching recommendations are also the most common sense. For example the report calls for legislation requiring the government to meet a higher standard before it can order a company to turn over private customer records. As it stands the law puts “extremely broad discretion in the hands of government officials” the report said.

It also calls for an end to the government’s mass storage of those records recommending that they be kept by the companies themselves or a private third party in order to prevent government abuse. Otherwise the report warns “high-level government officials will decide that this massive database of extraordinarily sensitive private information is there for the plucking.”

“Americans must never make the mistake of wholly ‘trusting’ our public officials” the authors write.

Among its many other important recommendations the report singles out the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court whose judges hear arguments in secret from the government alone with no opposition and issue classified rulings on significant constitutional issues. The panel said Congress should establish an advocate to argue in those hearings for the privacy and civil liberties interests of the public. And the selection of the court’s judges which now resides solely in the hands of the chief justice of the United States John Roberts Jr. should be divided among all the justices of the Supreme Court.

Perhaps most damning of all the report calls into doubt the central justification for the surveillance dragnet: preventing terrorism. Echoing the finding of a federal judge who ruled on Monday that the phone-data collection program was probably unconstitutional the report said the data sweep “was not essential to preventing attacks.”

The surveillance programs began before Mr. Obama’s presidency but he allowed them to continue and grow in unprecedented ways. Lately he has expressed an openness to reforming the programs themselves and the operations of the intelligence court. One important step would be to support legislation in Congress that would achieve many of the panel’s goals and codify them to restrain future presidents.

But Mr. Obama need not wait for Congress to act to implement the reforms he said he wants. He can quickly adopt his panel’s recommendation and end the ineffective and constitutionally dangerous dragnet surveillance."
_DC,Jul_23_2016_ACLU_Praises_New_Illinois_Limits_on_Cellphone_Surveillance.txt,"SPRINGFIELD Ill. — A new Illinois law limits how police can use devices that cast a wide net in gathering cellphone data and are at the center of a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department.

Gov. Bruce Rauner signed the legislation into law on Friday and drew immediate praise from civil libertarians.

The technology a cell site simulator is perhaps best known by the brand name Stingray. It gathers phone-usage data on targets of criminal investigations but it also gathers data on other cellphones — hundreds or even thousands of them — in the area.

The new law requires police to delete the phone information of anyone who wasn't an investigation target within 24 hours. It also prohibits police from accessing data for use in an investigation not authorized by a judge.

A dozen other states have adopted such regulations and Congress is considering legislation that would strengthen federal guidelines already in place.

""Cell site simulator technology too powerful to remain unregulated"" Khadine Bennett who is associate legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said in an emailed statement in which the group thanked the governor and Legislature for the new law. ""The federal government has adopted modest guidelines similar to those enacted today. If the restrictions are good enough for the FBI they should be workable for local law enforcement in Illinois.""

The Illinois State Police has taken a neutral position on the law and the Chicago Police Department did not take a position.

Chicago police are being sued by plaintiffs who are trying to force it to release records about how it uses this technology.

Privacy advocates worry that without limits on how much data can be gathered or how long it can be stored law enforcement could use the technology to build databases that track the behavior and movement of people who are not part of criminal investigations.

Authorities though have argued that cellphone tracking can be useful. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Seth M. Stodder testified before a congressional committee last year that Stingray technology led authorities to a 6-year-old girl who had been kidnapped in Arizona.

_DC,Jul_21_2012_Cellphone_Surveillance.txt,"To the Editor:

The article about law enforcement’s extensive surveillance of cellphone use (“More Demands on Cell Carriers in Surveillance” front page July 9) ought to concern all Americans about the threat to our Fourth Amendment rights. According to information supplied by carriers the police made more than 1.3 million requests an astounding number last year for text messages cellphone location and other data.

At the same time requests for wiretap warrants dropped suggesting that law enforcement is taking advantage of the failure of privacy safeguards to keep pace with evolving technology.

Certainly law enforcement ought to have access to cellphone location data when it can obtain a search warrant based on probable cause or to address true emergencies. But the law must be updated to ensure that Fourth Amendment safeguards apply in the digital age.

Until Congress or the courts act to require court orders cellphone users should understand that their private information may without their knowledge easily be subject to law enforcement’s routine surveillance.

_DC,Mar_19_2013_As_ARM_Chief_Steps_Down_Successor_Talks_About_'Body_Computing'.txt,"ARM Holdings the specialist in low-power semiconductors is looking to put computers everywhere around us and even inside us.

On Tuesday Warren East the company’s chief executive announced that he would step down after 12 years at the helm. Mr. East 51 will be succeeded by Simon Segars 45 who has been with ARM since 1991.

Mr. Segars said he would continue to develop Mr. East’s plan to make ARM chips a crucial element not just of smartphones and tablets where most are now used but also of computer servers sensors and networking gear. “Our alliances have broadened” he said. “There’s large growth potential ahead for ARM.”

It is the two men said part of a decade-long plan. “We’ve got a long-term planning horizon to 2020 and beyond” said Mr. East. “At 2020 I’d have been C.E.O. for over 20 years — that is bordering on a problem.”

ARM was originally a project inside Acorn Computer a personal computer maker long since broken up. From relative obscurity ARM’s chip designs now make up nearly one-third of new chip consumption hurting companies like Intel. ARM’s designs for chips are used in computer servers that are made by Hewlett-Packard and others that are useful for high transaction computing. And theyare regarded as a potentially huge development for new Internet applications.

The big coming focus Mr. Segars said will be deploying chips into a sensor-rich world. “Low-cost microcontrollers with a wireless interface” he said. “There will be billions of these.” The sensor data will be processed both locally on millions of small computers with capabilities to make decisions locally or collected and passed along to even bigger computer systems.

“The systems will go through different aggregation points” Mr. Segars said. “If an aggregator in the home can tell a fridge is using too much power maybe it needs servicing.”

The vision of lots of information being acted on across the network was akin to one described last week by Cisco Systems. In the ARM version however Cisco’s custom chips would face competition from cheaper versions from ARM much the way that ARM’s chips have pressed Intel’s. Mr. Segars noted that LSI has already deployed a networking product with an ARM design.

ARM also plans to get involved more deeply in solid state data storage considered a crucial part of Big Data analysis inside servers.

“It’s hard to get your head around” how many semiconductors will soon line the world Mr. Segars said. “The car is ripe for a revolution. It will evolve into a consumer electronics device paying for parking as you pull up to the curb.”

Eventually said Mr. East “it’s getting into people’s bodies. Over the next several years semiconductors will be so small and use so little power that they’ll run inside us as systems.”"
_DC,May_16_2010_Google’s_Data_Collection_Angers_European_Officials.txt,"He declined to speculate what action European officials might take.

Mr. Caspar said he had inspected one of Google’s Street View recording vehicles at the company’s invitation this month and had noticed that the recording device’s hard drive had been removed. When he asked to view the drive he said he was told he couldn’t read the information anyway because it was encoded. He said he pressed Google to disclose what type of information was being collected which prompted the company to examine the storage unit.

“I am glad that this cat-and-mouse game with Google is finally over” Mr. Caspar said. “I hope now that the company does what it says it will do.”

Over the weekend Germany's federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information Peter Schaar asked Google to let an independent regulator examine one of the hard drives to determine how much data had actually been collected on individuals.

In a blog posting written late Saturday on his official government Web site Mr. Schaar who is also a member of the panel that advises the European Commission on privacy and data protection issues questioned whether Google's collection of the data was a simple oversight as the company has maintained.

‘‘So everything was a simple oversight a software error!'' Mr. Schaar wrote. ‘‘The data was collected and stored against the will of the project's managers and other managers at Google. If we follow this logic further this means: The software was installed and used without being properly tested beforehand. Billions of bits of data were mistakenly collected without anyone in Google noticing it including Google's own internal data protection managers who two weeks ago were defending to us the company's internal data protection practices.''

“I think this is going to damage the company irreparably” said Simon Davies the director of Privacy International a London-based group of privacy advocates from 40 countries. “Three years ago the company was wearing a halo. But over the past year it has moved substantially in the direction of being perceived as Big Brother.”

Kay Oberbeck a Google spokesman in Hamburg said the company was in contact with data protection officials in Germany and in the rest of Europe to address their concerns. He disputed the notion that Google was recklessly collecting private information saying the company’s services were meant to let users control what information is made public.

“This was obviously a mistake and we are profoundly sorry” Mr. Oberbeck said. “We take individual privacy very seriously at Google. There was a breakdown in the communication between teams and within teams and we are investigating this and want to take up the lessons we learn from this to improve our processes and to have instruments installed which are really robust to make this never happen again.”

Google was collecting the data on locations of wireless networks to improve geolocation for mobile devices. Some cellphones can determine their location by scanning for nearby wireless networks and comparing that information to databases like the one Google has compiled.

Google plans to hire an outside auditor to investigate what personal data was collected through Street View. The improper collection of data came to light Mr. Oberbeck said after German data protection officials asked Google two weeks ago to detail exactly what information it had collected from household wireless local area networks or WLANs.

Initially Google had told German officials that the data it had collected was limited to just two bits of information: the publicly broadcast ID number of the device which is called a MAC address and the name assigned to it by the owner called an SSID.

But in its review Mr. Oberbeck said the company learned that its data collection performed by roving Street View vehicles was much more extensive including a record of sites viewed by the user and potentially the contents of messages if users did not secure their WLANS with a password.

Despite its internal efforts to address the situation Google may face an uphill battle in Germany overcoming skepticism about its intentions. So far thousands of Germans have signed up to have their properties excluded from Google’s Street View archives.

If Google’s software makes a mistake it could be costly for the company. Till Steffen the justice senator for the city-state of Hamburg where Google’s German headquarters is located said Google’s latest disclosure raised questions about its intent to follow local laws.

Mr. Steffen has introduced a bill in the German Parliament that would fine Google for displaying personal property in Street View without the consent of owners. On Saturday he demanded that Google turn over the illegally obtained information to regulators.

“Google is in the process of frittering away its last shred of credibility” Mr. Steffen said. “The company must immediately disclose to what degree it has secretly eavesdropped as we’ve sent e-mails to friends in Germany and the rest of Europe or as we’ve done our banking in the Internet.”

Mr. Steffen on May 7 introduced a bill in the upper house of the German Parliament that would fine Google 50000 euros or $62500 for each time it failed to remove the personal property of a citizen who requested to be exempted from Street View. Action on the bill is not likely before summer.

The latest episode will further complicate Google’s business in Europe where the company has faced a series of legal entanglements over privacy issues.

In April data protection regulators from eight European countries and Israel and New Zealand sent a joint letter to Google’s chief executive Eric E. Schmidt criticizing the company’s Buzz social networking service which unwittingly publicized the connections of some users without their permission.

In Switzerland Google has agreed to halt the display of further Street View images pending the outcome of a court case lodged by Swiss federal data protection officials."
_DC,Apr_29_2012_Google_Engineer_Told_Others_of_Data_Collection_F.C.C._Report_Reveals.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s harvesting of e-mails passwords and other sensitive personal information from unsuspecting households in the United States and around the world was neither a mistake nor the work of a rogue engineer as the company long maintained but a program that supervisors knew about according to new details from the full text of a regulatory report.

The report prepared by the Federal Communications Commission after a 17-month investigation of Google’s Street View project was released heavily redacted two weeks ago. Although it found that Google had not violated any laws the agency said Google had obstructed the inquiry and fined the company $25000.

On Saturday Google released a version of the report with only employees’ names redacted.

The full version draws a portrait of a company where an engineer can easily embark on a project to gather personal e-mails and Web searches of potentially hundreds of millions of people as part of his or her unscheduled work time and where privacy concerns are shrugged off.

The so-called payload data was secretly collected between 2007 and 2010 as part of Street View a project to photograph streetscapes over much of the civilized world. When the program was being designed the report says it included the following “to do” item: “Discuss privacy considerations with Product Counsel.”

“That never occurred” the report says.

Google says the data collection was legal. But when regulators asked to see what had been collected Google refused the report says saying it might break privacy and wiretapping laws if it shared the material.

A Google spokeswoman said Saturday that the company had much stricter privacy controls than it used to in part because of the Street View controversy. She expressed the hope that with the release of the full report “we can now put this matter behind us.”

Ever since information about the secret data collection first began to emerge two years ago Google has portrayed it as the mistakes of an unauthorized engineer operating on his own and stressed that the data was never used in any Google product.

The report quoting the engineer’s original proposal gives a somewhat different impression. The data the engineer wrote would “be analyzed offline for use in other initiatives.” Google says this was never done.

The report which was first published in its unredacted form by The Los Angeles Times also states that the engineer who began the project as part of his “20 percent” time that Google gives employees to do work on their own initiative “specifically told two engineers working on the project including a senior manager about collecting payload data.”

As early as 2007 the report says Street View engineers had “wide access” to the plan to collect payload data. Five engineers tested the Street View code a sixth reviewed it line by line and a seventh also worked on it the report says.

Privacy advocates said the full report put Google in a bad light.

“Google’s rogue engineer scenario collapses in light of the fact that others were aware of the project and did not object” said Marc Rotenberg executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “This is what happens in the absence of enforcement and the absence of regulation.”

The Street View program used special cars outfitted with cameras. Google first said it was just photographing streets and did not disclose that it was collecting Internet communications called payload data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks until May 2010 when it was confronted by German regulators.

Eventually it was forced to reveal that the information it had collected could include the full text of e-mails sites visited and other data.

Even if a user was not working on a computer at the moment the Street View car slowly passed if the device was on and the network was unencrypted all sorts of information about what the user had been doing could be scooped up data experts say.

“So how did this happen? Quite simply it was a mistake” a Google executive wrote on a company blog in 2010. “The project leaders did not want and had no intention of using payload data.”

But according to the report the engineer suggested in his proposal that it was entirely intentional: “We are logging user traffic along with sufficient data to precisely triangulate their position at a given time along with information about what they were doing.”

Attending to paperwork did not seem to be a high priority however. Managers of the Street View project told F.C.C. investigators that they never read the engineer’s proposal called a design document. A senior manager of Street View said he “preapproved” the document before it was written.

More than a dozen countries began investigations of Street View in 2010. In the United States the Justice Department the Federal Trade Commission state attorneys general and the F.C.C. looked into the matter.

The engineer at the center of the project cited the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Because F.C.C. investigators could not interview him they said there were still unresolved questions about the case."
_DC,Jun__6_2010_Google_faces_more_trouble_over_Wi-Fi_data_collection.txt,"Google's legal problems surrounding data collection around the world intensified today when it emerged that the company faces a police investigation in Australia the latest in a growing number of countries expressing concern about the its Street View mapping services.

The probe which comes amid accusations that Google breached privacy laws was announced a day after the firm agreed to hand over data it has collected through wireless networks to French German and Spanish authorities. Canada has also recently launched a probe into Google amid privacy concerns relating to the Street View service which uses camera-equipped fleets of cars to take 360 degree panoramic pictures for an online atlas.

Last month Google acknowledged it had mistakenly collected fragments of data over public and unsecured Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries as it was taking pictures of neighbourhoods. It said it discovered the problem after German regulators launched an inquiry into the matter.

In the UK the information commissioner ruled last year that Google's Street View technology carries a small risk of privacy invasion but should not be stopped although members of the public have taken direct action in at least one location to prevent the company from taking photographs on their streets.

Residents in Broughton blocked the driver of a Google Street View car which captures the photos when it tried to enter the village near Milton Keynes.

The Australian investigation comes as more regulators and consumers watchdogs around the world are complaining that Google does not take people's privacy seriously enough.

Google maintains that its users' privacy is one of the company's highest priorities. Australia's communications minister Stephen Conroy has accused Google of being responsible for the ""single greatest breach in the history of privacy"".

Google apologised saying it accidentally collected the information. The company and the Australian government are arguing over Senator Conroy's proposed mandatory internet filter which Google says amounts to censorship.

""There have been some complaints voiced … by the public in respect to practices that have been reported involving allegations that some information may have been obtained by staff of Google travelling around the streets"" said

Australia's federal attorney general Robert McClelland.

""In light of concerns having been raised by the public my department thought there were issues of substance that were raised that require police investigation."" The case was referred to the Australian federal police on Friday he said. It will focus on whether the company breached the country's telecommunications interceptions act which prevents people accessing electronic communications other than for authorised purposes.

""This was a mistake"" Google said in a statement. ""We are talking to the appropriate authorities to answer any questions they have.""

The US Federal Trade Commission has already begun an informal inquiry into the matter and Google has said it would co-operate with authorities.

Last month Michigan Democrat John Conyers the head of the House Judiciary Committee in the United States sent letters to Google and Facebook urging them to co-operate with any government privacy inquiries. Conyers asked Google to retain the data until any inquiries are complete.

Google first revealed that cars were also collecting wireless data in April but said no personal information from Wi-Fi networks was involved.

But after an audit requested by Germany Google acknowledged in May it mistakenly had collected samples of ""payload data.""

Suits have been filed in Washington California Massachusetts and Oregon by people who accuse Google of violating their privacy by collecting data from open Wi-Fi networks.

On its official blog Google has said that the software code responsible for collecting the data was used by mistake and that all Street View cars were grounded when the mistake was discovered."

According to the report the aim of these data is “to help the drive to eradicate the practice and to provide services and support for women and girls who have had FGM”. A year on it is evident that despite claims made about the usefulness of the data they are not fit for purpose. Collecting data at the point of encounters with clinicians is a futile way of collecting data about the population. It has previously been estimated that around 134600 women with FGM live in England. The Enhanced Dataset collects data about 1% of these women each quarter. It is unclear how the data collected can be used to achieve the stated aims.

Related: Caution needed with FGM statistics | Letters

Patients disclose sensitive information when a safe confidential space is created. It can take years for women with FGM to seek medical help. Clinicians are concerned that mandatory collection of confidential information without consent will damage trust in the doctor-patient relationship and discourage women with FGM from seeking medical attention. Separate and detailed data collection systems do not exist in other areas such as domestic abuse and rape. Let’s stop sensationalist headlines. Let’s recognise the limitations of this uninterpretable data collection and question whether the wider cost can be justified; and push for better data rather than peddle propaganda. Failure to do so risks setting back the many commendable efforts to tackle FGM in the UK.

• As a midwife and founder of the Female Genital Mutilation Clinical Group I read with interest the response from Professor Alison Macfarlane. Professor Macfarlane correctly draws attention to the misleading wording from the report on Health and Social Care Information Centre’s statistics (First annual FGM statistics show 5700 new cases across England 22 July) that should have said 5700 newly recorded cases of women and girls with FGM. But that is still 5700 newly recorded cases too many. For the first time we are starting to record the number of girls and women living in the UK whose lives have been damaged by this abhorrent procedure. The FGM Clinical Group campaigned for the recording of FGM in women and girls living in the UK. FGM is not legal in the UK and as clinicians we are trying to support and protect vulnerable women and girls who have had their lives and wellbeing damaged by the procedure. I applaud and support the recording and reporting of FGM as it allows us to start to address the issue. I agree with Professor Macfarlane that we need to be able to plan and commission proper health services and support for women and girls affected by FGM but we are in danger of missing the point and wasting time if we quibble about the precise numbers and details. It does not matter where or when the woman or girl was mutilated – she needs our help support and protection now.

_DC,Jun_28_2010_Europe_Pushes_Google_to_Turn_Over_Wi-Fi_Data.txt,"Google disclosed the error after a data protection supervisor in Hamburg Johannes Caspar asked to look at the information Google had been collecting in Germany.

French regulators said that at Google’s invitation they had remotely looked June 4 at the Wi-Fi data compiled in their country. Officials in Hamburg began inspecting the German data on Thursday and the Spanish regulator looked at its data remotely within the past two weeks Mr. Rallo said.

Following these initial inspections the agencies said their investigations remained open. Civil and criminal penalties are possible including criminal proceedings in France and Germany and fines of as much as €600000 or $738000 in Spain.

An official at one of the agencies who did not want to be identified because the investigation was not over said his agency had no way to verify the data it had seen. The official said that experts in his office were trying to check the information for completeness looking for unexplained geographic voids where no data had been recorded.

“Basically we have no way of knowing whether what we are looking at is authentic or not” the privacy official said.

Privacy lawyers were divided over whether Google’s offer to open the data to inspection remotely would settle the complaints. Twelve jurisdictions have asked Google to retain the data the company has collected in their countries or territories as they consider pursuing their own investigations. Those countries or territories are Belgium Canada the Czech Republic Finland France Germany Hong Kong Italy Greece Spain Switzerland and the United States.

On June 21 the attorney general of Connecticut Richard Blumenthal said his office would lead a 30-state investigation into Google’s Wi-Fi collection practices. A day later a group in Britain Privacy International asked the Metropolitan Police in London to investigate whether Google should face criminal charges. The London police say they will investigate joining prosecutors also weighing charges in Hamburg.

“The outcome of these investigations is still unclear and my sense is investigators are at the beginning of their efforts not at the end” said Christopher Kuner a lawyer who heads the European privacy practice in Brussels for Hunton & Williams a U.S. law firm that has represented Google in the past. “There are major questions still outstanding including who owns the data and whether local wiretapping laws were broken.”

Ulrich Börger a privacy lawyer in Hamburg for the U.S. firm Latham & Watkins said Google would most likely face a series of fines because of the episode but it said it doubted that the investigation would lead to new legal restrictions on the collection of wireless data.

“I think it’s probably fair to say that Google will likely end up facing some sanctions” said Mr. Börger whose firm has also advised Google. “But the laws in Europe are all different domestically so the outcome at this point is unclear.”

Google said it had been mapping the location of Wi-Fi routers to enhance its geo-location services which rely on pinpointing individuals on the go by detecting their mobile phones via Wi-Fi routers.

In the course of logging the address details of the routers Google said it had inadvertently recorded snippets of unencrypted Internet information sent over the routers as its cars passed by including passwords and the contents of some e-mails.

On June 6 Eric Schmidt the Google chief executive told The Financial Times that his company had “screwed up” and was taking disciplinary action against the programmer whose actions had led to the unauthorized recording of private data. Google has not identified the employee.

The newspaper also reported that Mr. Schmidt had authorized Google to “hand over” the data to regulators.

“We screwed up. Let’s be very clear about that” Mr. Schmidt said in the interview. “If you are honest about your mistakes it is the best defense for it not happening again.”

A Google spokesman in Brussels William Echikson said the company regretted its error in collecting the data and was working closely with investigators to resolve the situation. Google has destroyed the data collected in Ireland Denmark and Austria at the request of officials in those countries.

“As we have said before this was a mistake” Google said in a statement released by Mr. Echikson. “We are working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.”

Following its initial review of the data the French data privacy regulator the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés admonished Google for collecting the information.

French privacy regulators viewed the data collected in France a few weeks after their inspectors visited the Paris headquarters of Google on May 19. In its official statement on June 17 the French agency while critical did not mention sanctions saying its investigation remained open. Under French law the agency can reprimand Google fine the company as much as €150000 or refer the matter to a judge who could pursue criminal charges and fines against Google employees."
_DC,Jun_22_2010_States_to_Investigate_Google_Data_COllection.txt,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Connecticut’s attorney general said Monday that he would lead a multistate investigation into whether Google broke laws when it siphoned personal data off of wireless networks around the world. The company has said the data collection was inadvertent.

Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said more than 30 states had participated in a recent conference call on the issue. He said consumers had a right to know what information was collected and whether states need to alter procedures to guard against such leaks in the future.

Shares in Google slid 1.4 percent to $492.81 in a relatively flat market.

In May Google said its cars photographing streets around the world had for years accidentally collected personal data — which a security expert said at the time could have included e-mail messages and passwords — sent by consumers over wireless networks.

“My office will lead a multistate investigation — expected to involve a significant number of states — into Google’s deeply disturbing invasion of personal privacy” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement.

“Consumers have a right and a need to know what personal information — which could include e-mails Web browsing and passwords — Google may have collected how and why.”

Mr. Blumenthal said Google has cooperated but “its response so far raises as many questions as it answers.”

“Our investigation will consider whether laws may have been broken and whether changes to state and federal statutes may be necessary” he said.

Google already faces an informal investigation over the matter by the Federal Trade Commission a variety of inquiries overseas and class-action lawsuits.

Google has said the data was accidentally collected by its “Street View” cars well known for crisscrossing the globe and taking panoramic pictures of city streets which the company displays in its online maps product.

“It was a mistake for us to include code in our software that collected payload data but we believe we did nothing illegal. We’re working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns” a Google spokeswoman Christine Chen said in an e-mail message.

The company says it uses the location of Wi-Fi networks to enhance location-based services on smartphones.

It first revealed that Street View cars were collecting wireless data in April but said that no personal data was involved. After an audit requested by Germany Google acknowledged in May that it had been mistakenly collecting samples of “payload data.”

Mr. Blumenthal also released a letter sent to Google in mid-June asking for more details of the data collection. He had written to Google previously and the company had responded.

In the second letter Mr. Blumenthal asked the company when it realized that its Street View cars had collected the extra data who audited or analyzed the Street View data collection program and whether information was ever extracted from the payload data.

_DC,Mar_21_2011_Weather_Underground_Tries_Crowdsourcing_Data_Collection.txt,"Kevin Bleier an amateur meteorologist lugged a weather station up several precarious ladders to reach the peaked roof on his 40-foot-tall house in Alameda Calif. then mounted it on a 15-foot pole to capture data for his personal weather site.

But the data is not for Mr. Bleier’s site alone. His station and over 20000 like it worldwide are part of the largest network of weather stations ever assembled according to the meteorological Web site Weather Underground.

The network is part of an audacious plan to crowd-source weather measurement and Weather Underground hopes to snatch viewers from its larger competitor the Weather Channel’s Weather.com. In the last six months Weather Underground has averaged about 14 million unique visitors a month in the United States while Weather.com attracted about 42 million according to Quantcast an online metrics company.

“What’s new right now is we’re taking that data and we’re generating forecasts from those stations” said Alan Steremberg president and co-founder of Weather Underground.

Those predictions are being made through a tool BestForecast that analyzes the accuracy of different forecasting models and improves them over time by comparing their predictions with reported conditions. The tool considers 70 models before generating a forecast for each station using the best one and then reports the precision of past forecasts to users.

The personal-station network will augment data from the 10000 or so National Weather Service stations in the United States and national and international networks of stations (called mesonets) like the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Mr. Steremberg said he believed that his company’s network would lead to more accurate forecasts because there would be more real data points to verify predictions.

“We’re just trying to build our own system that has more sensors” he said. The “unfortunate downfall” of the Weather Channel’s system he said “is they don’t have as many sensors as we have.”

Ian Miller the Weather Channel’s senior vice president for weather systems disputed Mr. Steremberg’s assertion. He wrote in an e-mail that the Weather Channel’s proprietary forecasting tool TruPoint which relies on the United States’ “fairly dense network of high quality observations” is “a different — and better — paradigm than gathering data from fixed sensors.”

He said the Weather Channel decided against incorporating mesonets and personal stations because they “are not always reliable because installation and maintenance of sensors is crucial and these unofficial results do not have a professional insight of a meteorologist.”

But he conceded “we periodically revisit this item because some could add value” in remote areas of Colorado for example or highly variable climates like the California coast. “We do plan to add them regionally on a very limited basis by applying our quality assurance rules.”

David Robinson New Jersey’s state climatologist and a professor of geography at Rutgers University agreed with Mr. Miller’s assessment of the risks but was enthusiastic about the additional data.

“The more observations and the better observations you have the better the forecast will be” Professor Robinson said.

The professor oversees two networks in New Jersey and emphasized that care had to be taken when placing stations because they provided unreliable information if poorly located perhaps too near ventilation or air-conditioning or in direct sunlight without a shield for temperature gauges.

“The thing you need to ask yourself when you see stations for a network is how are these stations situated?” Mr. Robinson said. “There’s a lot of potential useful data being gathered but buyer beware.”

Unlike observers for the National Weather Service who are provided equipment instruction and maintenance from the federal government station owners like Mr. Bleier are on their own.

Mr. Steremberg said a Weather Underground algorithm developed over the last decade culls incorrect data and removes the offending station from its grid then contacts the malfunctioning station’s owner.

“We apply what we call the sanity check and make sure that the variable is physically possible” by cross-referencing it with nearby stations Mr. Steremberg said. “So we drop the bad stations even before the forecasting.” He said roughly 40000 stations had joined the worldwide network since 2001 but about half had been removed for quality reasons or had since gone inactive.

Another issue is that owners like Mr. Bleier must buy their own stations which cost from about $110 to over $1400 and use spare time to maintain them without pay.

Toby Skinner Weather Underground’s marketing director believes users are compensated for the expense.

“They get a lot of archiving they get map graphing and charts” Mr. Skinner said. “A lot of these people may have their own local Web sites community Web sites and we provide the link to them so we’re providing some exposure.”

But for the weather fans with stations participation is often its own reward.

“When I was a kid growing up in the ’60s I would have died for this kind of information” Mr. Robinson said. “There’s almost enough weather stations that people will be tripping over them.”"

NOW that we sense the magnitude of our government’s effort to track Americans’ telephone and Internet transactions the issue finally and fully before us is not how we balance personal privacy with police efficiency.

We have long since surrendered a record of our curiosities and fantasies to Google. We have broadcast our tastes and addictions for the convenience of one-button Amazon shopping. We have published our health and financial histories in exchange for better and faster hospital and bank services. We have bellowed our angers and frustrations for all to overhear while we walk the streets or ride a bus. Privacy is a currency that we all now routinely spend to purchase convenience.

But Google and Amazon do not indict prosecute and jail the people they track and bug. The issue raised by the National Security Agency’s data vacuuming is how to protect our civil liberty against the anxious pursuit of civic security. Our rights must not be so casually bartered as our Facebook chatter. Remember “inalienable”?

I envy the commentators who after a few days of vague discussion think they have heard enough to strike the balance between liberty and security. Many seem confident that the government is doing nothing more than relieving Verizon and AT&T and Facebook of their storage problems so that government agents can on occasion sift through years of phone and Internet records if they need to find a contact with a suspicious foreigner. Many Americans accept assurances that specific conversations are only rarely exhumed and only if the oddly named Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allows it. Such sifting and warrants — in unexplained combination with more conventional intelligence efforts — are now said by President Obama and his team to have prevented several dozen potential terrorist attacks with elliptical references to threats against New York City’s subways and stock exchange.

Even if true and satisfying these assurances are now being publicized only because this huge data-gathering effort can no longer be denied. Whatever the motive for the leaks by Edward J. Snowden they have stimulated a long-overdue public airing. Although the government’s extensive data-hauling activity was partly revealed by diligent reporters and a few disapproving government sources over the last seven years the undeniable proof came only from Mr. Snowden’s documents. Until then the very existence of the enterprise was “top secret” and publicly denied even in Congressional hearings. Even now the project remains a secret in every important respect.

As those of us who had to defend the 1971 publication of the secret Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam War have been arguing ever since there can be no mature discussion of national security policies without the disclosure — authorized or not — of the government’s hoard of secrets.

HOW many thousands have access to these storage bins? Who decides to open any individual file and who then gains access to its content? Is there ever a chance to challenge the necessity of opening a file? And what happens to gleaned information that has no bearing whatsoever on terrorism?"
_GOVT_SURV,Jun__6_2013_NSA_Prism_program_taps_in_to_user_data_of_Apple_Google_and_others.txt,"The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google Facebook Apple and other US internet giants according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.

The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism which allows officials to collect material including search history the content of emails file transfers and live chats the document says.

The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims ""collection directly from the servers"" of major US service providers.

Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program.

In a statement Google said: ""Google cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.""

Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of Prism or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. ""If they are doing this they are doing it without our knowledge"" one said.

An Apple spokesman said it had ""never heard"" of Prism.

The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.

The program facilitates extensive in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.

It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants.

Disclosure of the Prism program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers.

The participation of the internet companies in Prism will add to the debate ignited by the Verizon revelation about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata.

Some of the world's largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan ""Your privacy is our priority"" – was the first with collection beginning in December 2007.

It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand with other providers due to come online.

Collectively the companies cover the vast majority of online email search video and communications networks.

The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies.

Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users' communications under US law but the Prism program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies' servers. The NSA document notes the operations have ""assistance of communications providers in the US"".

The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the Fisa Amendments Act in December 2012 who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces.

When the FAA was first enacted defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.

A chart prepared by the NSA contained within the top-secret document obtained by the Guardian underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email video and voice chat videos photos voice-over-IP (Skype for example) chats file transfers social networking details and more.

The document is recent dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy.

The Prism program allows the NSA the world's largest surveillance organisation to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders.

With this program the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications as well as perform real-time collection on targeted users.

The presentation claims Prism was introduced to overcome what the NSA regarded as shortcomings of Fisa warrants in tracking suspected foreign terrorists. It noted that the US has a ""home-field advantage"" due to housing much of the internet's architecture. But the presentation claimed ""Fisa constraints restricted our home-field advantage"" because Fisa required individual warrants and confirmations that both the sender and receiver of a communication were outside the US.

""Fisa was broken because it provided privacy protections to people who were not entitled to them"" the presentation claimed. ""It took a Fisa court order to collect on foreigners overseas who were communicating with other foreigners overseas simply because the government was collecting off a wire in the United States. There were too many email accounts to be practical to seek Fisas for all.""

The new measures introduced in the FAA redefines ""electronic surveillance"" to exclude anyone ""reasonably believed"" to be outside the USA – a technical change which reduces the bar to initiating surveillance.

The act also gives the director of national intelligence and the attorney general power to permit obtaining intelligence information and indemnifies internet companies against any actions arising as a result of co-operating with authorities' requests.

In short where previously the NSA needed individual authorisations and confirmation that all parties were outside the USA they now need only reasonable suspicion that one of the parties was outside the country at the time of the records were collected by the NSA.

The document also shows the FBI acts as an intermediary between other agencies and the tech companies and stresses its reliance on the participation of US internet firms claiming ""access is 100% dependent on ISP provisioning"".

In the document the NSA hails the Prism program as ""one of the most valuable unique and productive accesses for NSA"".

It boasts of what it calls ""strong growth"" in its use of the Prism program to obtain communications. The document highlights the number of obtained communications increased in 2012 by 248% for Skype – leading the notes to remark there was ""exponential growth in Skype reporting; looks like the word is getting out about our capability against Skype"". There was also a 131% increase in requests for Facebook data and 63% for Google.

The NSA document indicates that it is planning to add Dropbox as a PRISM provider. The agency also seeks in its words to ""expand collection services from existing providers"".

The revelations echo fears raised on the Senate floor last year during the expedited debate on the renewal of the FAA powers which underpin the PRISM program which occurred just days before the act expired.

Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware specifically warned that the secrecy surrounding the various surveillance programs meant there was no way to know if safeguards within the act were working.

""The problem is: we here in the Senate and the citizens we represent don't know how well any of these safeguards actually work"" he said.

""The law doesn't forbid purely domestic information from being collected. We know that at least one Fisa court has ruled that the surveillance program violated the law. Why? Those who know can't say and average Americans can't know.""

Other senators also raised concerns. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon attempted without success to find out any information on how many phone calls or emails had been intercepted under the program.

When the law was enacted defenders of the FAA argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers.

When the NSA reviews a communication it believes merits further investigation it issues what it calls a ""report"". According to the NSA ""over 2000 Prism-based reports"" are now issued every month. There were 24005 in 2012 a 27% increase on the previous year.

In total more than 77000 intelligence reports have cited the PRISM program.

Jameel Jaffer director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy that it was astonishing the NSA would even ask technology companies to grant direct access to user data.

""It's shocking enough just that the NSA is asking companies to do this"" he said. ""The NSA is part of the military. The military has been granted unprecedented access to civilian communications.

""This is unprecedented militarisation of domestic communications infrastructure. That's profoundly troubling to anyone who is concerned about that separation.""

A senior administration official said in a statement: ""The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States.

""The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the Executive Branch and Congress. It involves extensive procedures specifically approved by the court to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted and that minimize the acquisition retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons.

""This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate.

""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.

""The Government may only use Section 702 to acquire foreign intelligence information which is specifically and narrowly defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This requirement applies across the board regardless of the nationality of the target.""

_GOVT_SURV,Nov_15_2013_C.I.A._Collects_Global_Data_on_Transfers_of_Money.txt,"Juan Zarate a White House and Treasury official under President George W. Bush said that unlike telecommunications information there has generally been less sensitivity about the collection of financial data in part because the government already collects information on large transactions under the Bank Secrecy Act.

“There is a longstanding legal baseline for the U.S. government to collect financial information” said Mr. Zarate who is also the author of “Treasury’s War” about the crackdown on terrorist financing. He did not acknowledge the C.I.A. program.

Orders for business records from the surveillance court generally prohibit recipients from talking about them. A spokeswoman for one large company that handles money transfers abroad Western Union did not directly address a question about whether it had been ordered to turn over records in bulk but said that the company complies with legal requirements to provide information.

“We collect consumer information to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws” said the spokeswoman Luella Chavez D’Angelo. “In doing so we also protect our consumers’ privacy.”

In recent months there have been hints in congressional testimony declassified documents and litigation that the N.S.A. program — which was disclosed by Edward J. Snowden a former N.S.A. contractor — is not unique in collecting records involving Americans.

For example the American Civil Liberties Union is fighting a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for documents related to Section 215 of the Patriot Act the provision that allows the government to compel companies to turn over business records for counterterrorism purposes. After the government declassified the N.S.A. phone records program it has released many documents about it in response to the suit.

But the government has notified the A.C.L.U. that it is withholding two Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rulings invoking Section 215 — one dated Aug. 20 2008 and the other Nov. 23 2010 — because they discuss matters that remain classified according to Alexander Abdo an A.C.L.U. lawyer. “It suggests very strongly that there are other programs of surveillance that the public has a right to know about” Mr. Abdo said.

In addition a Justice Department “white paper” on the N.S.A.’s call records program released in August said that communications logs are “a context” in which the “collection of a large volume of data” is necessary for investigators to be able to analyze links between terrorism suspects and their associates. It did not say that call records are the only context that meets the criteria for bulk gathering.

In hearings on Capitol Hill government officials have repeatedly avoided saying that phone logs — which include date duration and numbers of phone calls but not their content — are the only type of data that would qualify for bulk collection under the Patriot Act provision. In a little-noticed exchange late in an Oct. 3 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Gen. Keith B. Alexander the N.S.A. director appeared to go further.

At the hearing Senator Mazie K. Hirono Democrat of Hawaii asked General Alexander and James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence a sweeping question: “So what are all of the programs run by the N.S.A. or other federal agencies” that used either Section 215 of the Patriot Act or another surveillance law that allows warrantless wiretapping of phone and emails?

General Alexander responded by describing once again the N.S.A.’s call records program adding “None of that is hid from you.” Mr. Clapper said nothing.

Then moments later General Alexander interjected that he was talking only about what the N.S.A. is doing under the Patriot Act provision and appearing to let slip that other agencies are operating their own programs.

“You know that’s of course a global thing that others use as well but for ours it’s just that way” General Alexander said.

In September the Obama administration declassified and released a lengthy opinion by Judge Claire Eagan of the surveillance court written a month earlier and explaining why the panel had given legal blessing to the call log program. A largely overlooked passage of her ruling suggested that the court has also issued orders for at least two other types of bulk data collection.

Specifically Judge Eagan noted that the court had previously examined the issue of what records are relevant to an investigation for the purpose of “bulk collections” plural. There followed more than six lines that were censored in the publicly released version of her opinion.

Lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have been trying to gain more information about other bulk collection programs.

In September Representative Jim Sensenbrenner Republican of Wisconsin and an author of the original Patriot Act sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asking if the administration was collecting bulk records aside from the phone data. An aide said he had yet to get a response. Even lawmakers on the Intelligence Committees have indicated that they are not sure they understand the entire landscape of what the government is doing in terms of bulk collection.

Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee recently sent a classified letter to Mr. Clapper asking for a full accounting of every other national security program that involves bulk collection of data at home or abroad according to government officials."

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked a sweeping overhaul of the once-secret National Security Agency program that collects records of Americans’ phone calls in bulk.

Democrats and a handful of Republicans who supported the measure failed to secure the 60 votes they needed to take up the legislation. The vote was 58 to 42 for consideration.

Senator Patrick J. Leahy the Vermont Democrat who drafted the bill blamed what he said was fear-mongering by the bill’s opponents for its defeat. “Fomenting fear stifles serious debate and constructive solutions” he said. “This nation deserves more than that.”

Senator Mitch McConnell the Republican leader worked hard to defeat the bill which had the support of the Obama administration and a coalition of technology companies including Apple Google Microsoft and Yahoo.

“This is the worst possible time to be tying our hands behind our backs” Mr. McConnell said before the vote expressing the concerns of those who argued that the program was a vital tool in the fight against terrorism.

But Tuesday’s vote only put off until next year a debate over security and personal liberties. While a Republican-controlled Senate is less likely to go along with the kinds of reforms that were in the bill which sponsors had named the U.S.A. Freedom Act the debate could further expose rifts between the party’s interventionist and more libertarian-leaning wings.

The new Congress will also be working against a hard deadline because the legal authority for the data collection will expire next year.

Under the bill which grew out of the disclosures in June 2013 by Edward J. Snowden the former intelligence contractor the N.S.A. would have gotten out of the business of collecting Americans’ phone records. Instead most of the records would have stayed in the hands of the phone companies which would not have been required to hold them any longer than they already do for normal business purposes which in some cases is 18 months.

The N.S.A. Mr. Snowden revealed was systematically collecting telephone metadata — information about who called whom but not the content of what was said — from major American phone companies. The program began after the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks based on an assertion of unilateral executive power by President George W. Bush. In 2006 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court secretly brought the program under its authority and started issuing orders to the companies under the Patriot Act.

The proposed legislation would still have allowed analysts to perform so-called contact chaining in which they trace a suspect’s network of acquaintances but they would been required to use a new kind of court order to swiftly obtain only those records that were linked up to two layers away to a suspect — even when held by different phone companies.

In January President Obama announced some changes to the program including requiring court approval before a new number could be used to query the database and limiting analysts to scrutinizing the records of callers two — down from three — layers removed.

The Republican-controlled House passed a version of the bill in May but it was watered down before passage losing the support of civil liberties groups. The deadline for new legislation is next June when the legal basis for the phone records program a provision of the Patriot Act expires.

After that when the 90-day orders to phone companies requiring them to turn over their customers’ records expire the surveillance court would be unable to issue a new round of orders.

The Obama administration warning of the potential for “brinkmanship and uncertainty” next spring if the bill did not pass had strongly urged the Senate to support it even though it initially resisted efforts on Capitol Hill to rein in the N.S.A. programs.

And it may not be any easier for a compromise to be reached over the bill next year. Some of its opponents like Senator Saxby Chambliss Republican of Georgia believe it went too far in curbing the N.S.A. Others like Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky thought it did not go far enough.

One possibility would be a bill that is scaled back enough to win over more hawkish Republicans while relying on the votes of some Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein of California who were more skeptical of broad-based reform.

It is unknown how the 11 new Republicans who will join the Senate next year might alter the debate. For instance Cory Gardner of Colorado who will replace Senator Mark Udall one of the Senate’s staunchest advocates of N.S.A. changes has been supportive of ending bulk record collection. Steve Daines the incoming Republican senator from Montana also voted yes with Mr. Gardner on a contentious proposal to strip funding for bulk collection when the House took up the issue last year.

Other Republican members of the House who will join the Senate next year — Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Tom Cotton of Arkansas and James Lankford of Oklahoma — voted no.

But resistance from inside the Republican Party has been unrelenting. Before Tuesday’s vote two top former officials from the Bush administration — Michael B. Mukasey the former attorney general and Michael V. Hayden the former N.S.A. and C.I.A. director essentially called the bill a gift to terrorists in an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal that carried the headline “N.S.A. Reform That Only ISIS Could Love.”

The debate over curtailing the N.S.A.'s ability to collect telephone call data is just one example of how Republicans will continue to grapple with questions of privacy and security as the 2016 presidential elections near. At the center of the debate on Tuesday were three senators considering a run for president: Mr. Paul of Kentucky Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida.

Mr. Rubio voted against the measure calling it “a reaction to misinformation and alarmism.” Mr. Paul also voted no but because he believed it did not do enough to restrict the N.S.A. Supporters of the overhaul had worked all day to persuade him to switch his vote to no avail. He said Tuesday he would prefer the entire Patriot Act be allowed to expire.

Mr. Cruz voted yes saying “It is imperative that we stand together protecting the Bill of Rights.”

_GOVT_SURV,Jun__6_2016_Official_correspondence_reveals_lack_of_scrutiny_of_MI5's_data_collection.txt,"The watchdog that monitors interception of emails and phone calls by the intelligence services allowed MI5 to escape regular scrutiny of its bulk collection of communications data according to newly released confidential correspondence.

A highly revealing exchange of letters from 2004 has been published by Privacy International (PI) before Monday’s parliamentary debate on the investigatory powers bill sometimes called the snooper’s charter.



The campaign group argues that the letters demonstrate the relationship between government agencies and the independent organisation that is supposed to oversee and regulate their activities has been too “cosy”.

The correspondence has been disclosed in the course of legal action between PI and the government at the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) which is due to be heard in full this year. The IPT deals with complaints about the intelligence services and surveillance by public bodies. GCHQ is alleged to be illegally collecting “bulk personal datasets” from the phone and internet records of millions of people who have no ties to terrorism and are not suspected of any crime.

The letters were sent by Home Office legal advisers GCHQ and Sir Swinton Thomas who was the interception of communications commissioner. The organisation is now called the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Office (IOCCO).

In May 2004 a Home Office legal adviser wrote to Thomas backing an MI5 proposal that collecting bulk data from communication service providers for its “database project” be authorised under section 94 of the 1984 Telecommunications Act because at that stage there were no human rights implications or breach of privacy concerns. Using that act would not require a notice to be put before parliament because it could be used secretively on the grounds that “disclosure of the direction would be against the interests of national security”.



Thomas wrote back the following month expressing reservations about such clandestine authorisation. He proposed that it would be better to use the more modern and exacting Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) which involves more open legal procedures and safeguards.

Related: GCHQ hacking does not breach human rights security tribunal rules

The Home Office responded saying that although Ripa might be engaged it did not think that meant it must be used. The letter continued: “The only practical difference between the two sets of provisions is if [Ripa] were used a new notice would need to be issued every month … involving a fresh consideration of the necessity and proportionality issues. This would not be the case under section 94 [of the Telecommunications Act].”

Thomas backed down replying that “on reconsideration” use of Ripa was not mandatory. He added: “I am also impressed by the considerable and if possible to be avoided inconvenience in following the [Ripa] procedure in the database procedures.”

GCHQ wrote to Thomas in October that year after he had visited its Cheltenham headquarters. “Huges volumes of data are acquired (about 40m bits of data a day)” it informed him. “In the interests of security and commercial confidentiality GCHQ prefers to keep all the telephony material together in one database … to disguise its source as the origin of some of the material is extremely sensitive.”



GCHQ also asked whether access to communications data for its databases would be lawful under the Telecommunications Act rather than the more burdensome Ripa.

Thomas said it was not a straightforward problem but eventually acquiesced saying: “I have therefore reached the conclusion not without some difficulty that the present system for retrieval [under the Telecommunications Act] is lawful. As you say adhering to the spirit of the legislation is important.”



The debate goes some way to explain official thinking on the legal distinction between anonymised bulk data collection and a second stage of interception where material may be matched to individuals.



The latest revelation follows an earlier release of confidential documents by PI last month that showed how GCHQ MI5 and MI6 obtain personal data from public and private organisations including financial institutions the NHS electronic petitions record databases and others.

Privacy International said the letters exemplified the “total failure” of oversight.



Caroline Wilson Palow the organisation’s general counsel said: “The documents demonstrate the government’s troubling history of over-reaching in order to expand its surveillance powers while minimising safeguards.



“This discussion between lawyers for MI5 and GCHQ and the interception of communications commissioner is also an illuminating example of how oversight can go wrong when it lacks sufficient transparency resources and advocates for the individuals whose privacy may be violated.



“We think the commissioner’s conclusions were incorrect permitting GCHQ to acquire communications data in bulk under a broad and secret interpretation of a power to which few safeguards attach. Indeed the commissioner even agrees with GCHQ and MI5 that collecting our communications data from service providers would not be an interference with our privacy – a position that would likely come as a surprise to most of us and is in direct conflict with recent court decisions.”

Sir Stanley Burnton the interception commissioner at IOCCO said: “We have recently concluded our comprehensive review of section 94 [Telecommunications Act] directions which have been issued by secretaries of state from various government departments since the late 1990s after taking this additional oversight on at the request of the prime minister in 2015.

“Our review has been very challenging because all the section 94 directions are subject to statutory secrecy provisions which limit severely what we are able to say publicly about them. Nevertheless our review report sets out an extensive series of recommendations which must be implemented in order to clarify and bring consistency to the procedures in place remedy the lack of record-keeping requirements and codified processes and ensure that we are able to undertake this additional oversight and audit of the giving and use of section 94 directions properly. Our report is due to be published at the end of June or early July.”

“We welcome and support Privacy International’s proposal for oversight bodies to be supported by public interest advocates and their calls for further transparency in these matters.”

A letter sent by the director of national intelligence James Clapper to Ron Wyden a Democratic senator for Oregon on Friday said that there had been ""a number of compliance problems"" with the NSA's bulk ongoing collection of millions of Americans' phone records but ""no findings of any intentional or bad-faith violations"".

On the Senate floor late on Tuesday afternoon Wyden a member of the Senate intelligence committee all but accused Clapper of lying.

Citing classified documents that he did not specify but referring to ""violations of court orders"" Wyden said that ""these violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community and are troubling"". Wyden urged senators to read classified intelligence documents about the bulk surveillance for themselves.

""Any policymaker who simply defers to intelligence officials without asking to see their evidence is making a mistake"" Wyden warned.

Clapper has already apologised for untruthfully testifying during a March Senate colloquy with Wyden that the NSA does ""not wittingly"" collect data on millions of Americans. Representatives for Clapper did not immediately return a request for comment on Wyden's accusation.

""The violations I've touched on tonight are a lot more serious than [senators] have been told"" Wyden said. ""I'm going to keep pressing to make more of these details public.""

Wyden's frequent partner on the intelligence committee Mark Udall a Democratic senator for Colorado called on the White House for a ""more effective less intrusive"" way to collect phone records related to national security.

""Conduct the program instead through direct queries to phone companies where there is a direct connection to terrorism and espionage"" Udall urged on the Senate floor.

Like Wyden Udall criticised intelligence leaders and their political allies for saying the bulk phone-records collection had helped to stop terrorists.

""I have seen no evidence that the bulk phone-records collection alone played a meaningful role or any role in disrupting terrorist plots"" Udall said.

It may be ""more convenient"" for the NSA to conduct a phone-records dragnet Udall said but ""convenience alone cannot justify"" the effort.

Udall also briefly said that the NSA phone-records programme includes the ""who what where when and how long"" of Americans' phone calls – seemingly a reference to NSA tracking location data on phone calls which a number of intelligence officials including Clapper in his letter have said they do not perform ""under this programme"".

""Information on whom [Americans] call when they call and where they call from is private information"" Udall said.

A Udall spokesman clarified that the Senator was not talking about cellular-site tracking but more about landline location.

Citing the razor-thin margin by which the NSA's bulk phone-records collection survived a vote last week in the House of Representatives Wyden and Udall vowed to continue their push to curtail the programme.

""Make no mistake about it … we are going to stay at this"" Wyden said.

On Wednesday morning the Senate judiciary committee will hold its first hearing into the NSA programmes with anticipated testimony from senior officials from the justice department and NSA. The committee is chaired by Senator Patrick Leahy (Democrat Vermont) who alone among committee chairmen in the Senate and House is vocally in favour of shutting the bulk collection down. Ahead of the hearing the Obama administration is considering declassifying more secret documents from the Fisa court explaining how the bulk collection is conducted. The Los Angeles Times reported that one of those documents under consideration is a 2007 Fisa court order governing the rules for bulk phone-records collection."
_GOVT_SURV,Jul__2_2014_Some_NSA_data_collection_is_'legal_and_effective'_says_independent_board.txt,"An independent board has declared a set of National Security Agency data collection programs both ""legal and effective in protecting national security"" despite expressing concern about ""intrusions"" into individuals' privacy.

As the NSA's troves of ostensibly foreign emails and Americans' international communications come under heavy scrutiny the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board dealt the NSA a victory on Tuesday night by calling the information reaped ""valuable"". It pointedly rejected similar claims for the bulk collection of US call data in a January report.

Under the so-called ""702 program"" – named after section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 – the NSA can harvest large amounts of ostensibly foreign digital information including Americans' international communications.

But the board did question the NSA's intrusion into Americans' data and recommended limits to the government's ability to access large amounts of American communications data that the NSA inevitably collects and searches through without a warrant.

More than 25% of NSA's terrorism reporting is based on information taken under 702 the PCLOB found. The section also allows it to collect data from telecommunications and internet providers known as Prism and less frequently data in transit ""upstream"" across the internet itself.



""It has played a key role in discovering and disrupting specific terrorist plots aimed at the United States and other countries"" the PCLOB found in a 200-page report released in draft form late on Tuesday endorsing a central NSA claim since Edward Snowden leaked information revealing the scope of the surveillance agency's powers.



Yet the board stopped short of endorsing the NSA's claim last year that information gleaned under section 702 led to the disruption of 54 terrorist plots. In ""approximately 30 cases"" 702 information was the ""catalyst"" for such disruption and in another 20 such information aided an existing investigation. Most plots as the NSA has itself said occurred overseas; and the PCLOB said the successful disruptions began with ""narrowly focused surveillance of a specific individual.""



In another vindication for the NSA the PCLOB assessed that the NSA's massive amounts of data collected under section 702 is not ""bulk"" collection describing itself as ""impressed with the rigor"" of government surveillance targeting.



The NSA defends its Prism and ""upstream"" communications troves long after it has accepted divestiture of US phone records. Representatives from the intelligence agencies and the Obama administration sternly defend both the legality and the wisdom of retaining those content and metadata databases as a measure to defend the US against terrorism espionage and even crime.



But the PCLOB also found elements of the mass communications collection ""push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness"".



Those privacy concerns centre overwhelmingly on the rules by which the NSA and its partner agencies the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation can search through the NSA communications data troves for Americans' email addresses and references to Americans as well as the sheer volume of US person data ""incidentally"" caught in the NSA's massive data troves.



The PCLOB found that when the NSA takes data directly in transit from the internet its technical filters permit the capture of ""as many as tens of thousands"" of ""purely domestic communications"" although the scale of the Internet collection renders such harvesting a microfraction. Still the NSA appears not to have solved the technical problem nearly three years after a judge blasted the agency for it revised the NSA's rules ""minimising"" its dissemination or use of such data and prompted what the PCLOB called ""the purging of several years of prior collection.""



While wary the PCLOB largely considered legitimate the NSA's broad leeway in collecting a huge amount of foreigners' data – a single order in 2013 from a surveillance court resulted in collection of internet communications from 89138 ""targets"" – despite widespread global outrage over the scope of NSA surveillance and entreaties from US internet businesses who consider it an economic liability. It will however review presidential procedures aimed at limiting foreigners' vulnerability to the surveillance dragnets.



The PCLOB has yet to formally adopt the report and will vote on doing so at a hearing Wednesday morning in Washington.



While Congress granted the NSA broad powers to collect data in the 2008 law it barred the agency from intentionally targeting Americans under false pretenses called ""reverse targeting"". Yet civil libertarians have long considered the inevitable collection of US data within NSA's foreign-focused dragnets to render the reverse-targeting ban quaint.



Senator Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat often points to NSA's ability to search through the troves for Americans' information without a warrant as a ""backdoor search"" around constitutional privacy protections. In August thanks to leaks from Snowden the Guardian identified the secret provision permitting such searches.



A previously secret 2011 opinion of a judge on the Fisa Court found widespread overcollection of Americans' emails. The PCLOB report found that the secret court has limited independent visibility into how the NSA actually implements its Prism and upstream data collection. It also noted that neither the NSA nor the FBI has fulsomely declassified their targeting procedures but the PCLOB panelists also vouched for the NSA taking affirmative steps to determine in murky cases that a target is a non-American abroad.



While obscured by the NSA's bulk collection of US call records an issue that has consumed most of the legislative and media oxygen owing to its reach into the privacy of US citizens the PCLOB report points to the new scrutiny that the mass collection of ostensibly foreign emails calls texts and other communications content has received in recent weeks – albeit largely owing to NSA's abilities to siphon and search through Americans' international communication inside that enormous trove.



In late June the House of Representatives unexpectedly passed a measure to defund the government's ability to warrantlessly search through those communications content troves for Americans' information. It was a legislative route around a major surveillance reform bill belatedly championed by the White House and NSA that excluded a prohibition on the so-called ""backdoor search"" – an exclusion that helped cement the administration's support.



Significantly the PCLOB's recommendations stop far short of the House's action. Instead of banning the warrantless querying of Americans' data it says such queries should only occur ""based upon a statement of facts showing that the query is reasonably likely to return foreign intelligence information"" a determination it pointedly does not recommend a judge making.



Not only did the PCLOB find that the public law authorising the mass communications collection section 702 ""publicly outlines the basic structure of the program"" it blessed the NSA's controversial practice of collecting emails and calls that reference a surveillance target even though such so-called ""about"" collection does not necessarily come from surveillance targets themselves. It did however recommend a ""periodic"" assessment of the NSA's ""filtration"" techniques to prevent overcollection.



On Monday Wyden released a letter from the office of the director of national intelligence specifying that the NSA had performed searches within those databases in 2013 alone for 198 ""identifiers"" of Americans such as an email address or a phone number and another 9500 queries for associated metadata. No such searches were conducted pursuant to a warrant.

The PCLOB did not limit its scrutiny of section 702 data collection to the NSA. The CIA and FBI come in for in some cases greater privacy criticisms than does the widely-vilified NSA.



Both the FBI and CIA conduct their own searches through the troves – and can even access the raw Prism data on their own the PCLOB confirmed although they do not have direct access to ""upstream"" data. Additionally the PCLOB confirmed that while the NSA purges Prism and upstream data if it determines communications involving Americans do not provide foreign intelligence neither the FBI nor the CIA has any such requirement.



Indeed the board found that the FBI can disseminate US person information acquired under section 702 ""that reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information"" or even data deemed ""necessary to understand foreign intelligence information.""

_GOVT_SURV,Jul_26_2016_MI5_resisting_independent_oversight_of_bulk_data_collection.txt,"The security service MI5 has been repeatedly resisting independent oversight of its decision to collect communications data from tens of thousands of individuals previously secret documents have shown.

Four letters over the course of 2015 from the head of MI5 Andrew Parker to the then home secretary Theresa May complain that the non-statutory requirement recommended by both the intelligence and security committee and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation David Anderson is bureaucratic and risks hampering the agency’s response to security threats.

The letters were released as part of a four-day hearing of the investigatory powers tribunal brought by Privacy International against the bulk data collection by the intelligence agencies.

Privacy International said that Parker’s letters to May suggest repeated foot-dragging from MI5 and a reluctance to comply with the requirement.

Other previously secret documents released to the tribunal on Tuesday show that MI5 was repeatedly warned by the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Office [IOCCO] that it was breaching a code of practice on data collection that requires the agency to appoint a designated person independent of an investigation to authorise data collection.

The IOCCO found that MI5 had implemented independent oversight of data collection from people such as doctors and lawyers in professions with access to privileged or confidential information.

But in the majority of cases it found that “line managers are not independent from the operations for which they are granting authorisation or giving notices”. In December 2014 it urged MI5 to review its oversight measures. A year later it found that no progress had been made and reminded MI5 that the home secretary had said it was “imperative” that such independent oversight was achieved.

In Parker’s first letter to May dated 19 March 2015 he said independent oversight of data collection would “cause significant disruption” and “reduce our effectiveness … It would increase the processing time for [data] requests because those taking the decisions would not be familiar with the relevant investigative context”.

He went on to suggest there was no public clamour for the change. “There does not appear to be a pressing litigation or reputational requirement to commit to make these changes now and we can therefore see no obvious gain in doing so” Parker wrote. A month later Parker warned May that MI5 “will not hit your deadline” after she asked it to “strengthen the independence of authorisation for communications data”.



In the next letter sent on 30 June Parker reported progress in the oversight of communications data checks on persons in sensitive professions. But warned that making the change for all data requests would require more staff – the exact number is redacted. “We think there are significant risks from implementing independence for all CD [communications data] authorisations at this point” he said.

In the last letter dated 18 December 2015 Parker says he still has “strong reservations about agreeing now to more widespread changes for targeted CD requests”.

“We submitted a total of more than 100000 individual requests for communications data in 2014 through 40000 applications” Parker wrote. “If we were to switch to an arrangement where each of these has to be authorised by someone within MI5 who is unfamiliar with the case and who has to be sufficiently briefed to be able to make a considered decision we would be adding a non-trivial amount of administrative burden into our system at the same time as we work to increase assurance levels against a very high tempo of threat.”

In another set of letters released to the tribunal MI5 said the IOCCO had agreed that it did not need to have independent approval for data requests in ongoing operations. The IOCCO wrote back pointing out that the code of practice on communications intercepts required it to be informed by MI5 if it could not appoint an independent person and that it had not done so.

Millie Graham Wood a legal officer for Privacy International said the documents showed “there has been a lack of oversight which is still not on a statutory basis and a wilful avoidance of internal safeguards”.

She said they pointed to a “worrying practice” as they showed “the lack of a clear line of separation with the security service between investigative teams who request approval for a particular activity and those in the service who authorise”.

In a skeleton argument to the hearing lawyers for the intelligence services defended the use of bulk communications data [BCD]. It quoted a security service witness saying: “The use of BCD has stopped terrorist attacks and has saved lives many times.”

A witness for GCHQ is quoted saying: “Exploitation of BCD is an essential tool that is used on a daily basis ... without it the intelligence services would be significantly less effective in protecting the UK against threats such as terrorism cyber threats or espionage.”

The hearing continues."
_GOVT_SURV,Jan_18_2014_In_Keeping_Grip_on_Data_Pipeline_Obama_Does_Little_to_Reassure_Industry.txt,"In fact he did more than that: Mr. Obama reminded the country that it was not only the government that was monitoring users of the web it was also companies like Apple Facebook Twitter and Yahoo that had complained so loudly as members of an industry group called Reform Government Surveillance.

“Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy store and analyze our data and use it for commercial purposes” the president said. “That’s how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically.”

Translation: Corporate America wants to be able to mine Americans’ data but fears business will be hurt when the government uses it for intelligence purposes.

In fact behind the speech lies a struggle Mr. Obama nodded at but never addressed head on. It pits corporations that view themselves as the core of America’s soft power around the world — the country’s economic driver and the guardians of its innovative edge — against an intelligence community 100000 strong that regards its ability to peer into any corner of the digital world and manipulate it if necessary as crucial to the country’s security.

In public the coalition was polite if unenthusiastic about the president’s speech. His proposals the companies said in a statement “represent positive progress on key issues” even while “crucial details remain to be addressed on these issues and additional steps are needed on other important issues.”

But in the online chat rooms that users and employees of those services inhabit each day the president’s words were mocked. “If they really cared about the security of US infrastructure they’d divulge the vulnerabilities they found or bought from the black market that exploit the security of these systems so those systems can be fixed and no one else can exploit them with these exploits” wrote a user called “higherpurpose” on Hacker News.

“Instead they keep them for themselves so they can exploit them” the user wrote.

In an interview a senior administration official acknowledged that the administration had weighed what the president could say in public about the delicate problems of encryption or the N.S.A.’s use of “zero day” flaws in software the name for security holes that have never been seen before. It is a subject the intelligence agencies have refused to discuss in public and Mr. Obama determined that it was both too secret and too fluid to discuss in the speech officials said.

In response to questions the White House said the president had asked his special assistant for cybersecurity Michael Daniel and the president’s office of science and technology policy to study a recent advisory panel’s recommendation that the government get out of the business of corrupting the encryption systems created by American companies.

It will not be an easy task. One of the recent disclosures first reported by Reuters indicated that the N.S.A. paid millions of dollars to RSA a major encryption firm to incorporate a deliberately weakened algorithm into some of its products giving the government a “back door” to read whatever it wanted. But when the advisory panel concluded that the United States should not “in any way subvert weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software” the intelligence agencies protested.

“Some in the intelligence community saw that as a call for the N.S.A. to get out of cryptography which is the reason they were created” the senior official said. He added: “We’ve said that we are very much supportive of U.S. industry and making sure that U.S. industry remains competitive and able to produce really good products. And N.S.A. has been out there saying they have no interest in breaking encryption that guards global commerce.”

But as Mr. Obama himself acknowledged the United States has a credibility problem that will take years to address. The discovery that it had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany or that it has now found a way to tap into computers around the world that are completely disconnected from the Internet — using covert radio waves — only fuels the argument that American products cannot be trusted.

That argument heard these days from Berlin to Mexico City may only be an excuse for protectionism. But it is an excuse that often works.

“When your products are considered to not only be flawed but intentionally flawed in the support of intelligence missions don’t expect people to buy them” said Dan Kaminsky a security researcher and chief scientist at White Ops an antifraud company whose clients include many of the nation’s biggest data users

Mr. Obama will have to address those issues at some point. Every time he meets Silicon Valley executives many of whom enthusiastically campaigned for him they remind him of their complaints. But at the Justice Department on Friday he reminded them that the battle for cyberspace runs in all directions.

“We cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies” he said at one point in the speech. “There is a reason why BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room. We know that the intelligence services of other countries — including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures — are constantly probing our government and private sector networks and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations and intercept our emails and compromise our systems.”"
_GOVT_SURV,Nov__1_2013_Snowden_document_reveals_key_role_of_companies_in_NSA_data_collection.txt,"The key role private companies play in National Security Agency surveillance programs is detailed in a top-secret document provided to the Guardian by whistleblower Edward Snowden and published for the first time on Friday.

One slide in the undated PowerPoint presentation published as part of the Guardian's NSA Files: Decoded project illustrates the number of intelligence reports being generated from data collected from the companies.

In the five weeks from June 5 2010 the period covered by the document data from Yahoo generated by far the most reports followed by Microsoft and then Google.

Between them the three companies accounted for more than 2000 reports in that period – all but a tiny fraction of the total produced under one of the NSA's main foreign intelligence authorities the Fisa Amendents Act (FAA).

It is unclear how the information in the NSA slide relates to the companies' own transparency reports which document the number of requests for information received from authorities around the world.

Yahoo Microsoft and Google deny they co-operate voluntarily with the intelligence agencies and say they hand over data only after being forced to do so when served with warrants. The NSA told the Guardian that the companies' co-operation was ""legally compelled"".

But this week the Washington Post reported that the NSA and its UK equivalent GCHQ has been secretly intercepting the main communication links carrying Google and Yahoo users' data around the world and could collect information ""at will"" from among hundreds of millions of user accounts.

The NSA's ability to collect vast quantities of data from the fibre-optic cables relies on relationships with the companies the document published on Friday shows.

The presentation titled ""Corporate Partner Access"" was prepared by the agency's Special Source Operations division which is responsible for running those programs.

In an opening section that deals primarily with the telecom companies the SSO baldly sets out its mission: ""Leverage unique key corporate partnerships to gain access to high-capacity international fiber-optic cables switches and/or routes throughout the world.""

The NSA is helped by the fact that much of the world's communications traffic passes through the US or its close ally the UK – what the agencies refer to as ""home-field advantage"".

The new revelations come at a time of increasing strain in relations between the intelligence community and the private sector. Google and Yahoo reacted angrily on Wednesday to the Washington Post's report on the interception of their data.

The Guardian approached all three companies for comment on the latest document.

""This points out once again the need for greater transparency"" a Google spokesman said.

He referred to a letter the company and other Silicon Valley giants sent to the Senate judiciary committee on Thursday. ""The volume and complexity of the information that has been disclosed in recent months has created significant confusion here and around the world making it more difficult to identify appropriate policy prescriptions"" the letter said.

A Microsoft spokesperson said: ""We are deeply disturbed by these allegations and if true they represent a significant breach of trust by the US and UK governments. It is clear that there need to be serious reforms to better protect customer privacy.""

Yahoo had not responded by the time of publication.

The companies are also fighting through the courts to be allowed to release more detailed figures for the number of data requests they handle from US intelligence agencies. Along with AOL Apple and Facebook they wrote to the Senate judiciary committee this week calling for greater transparency and ""substantial"" reform of the NSA.

Google the first to publish a transparency report has reported US authorities' requests for user data increased by 85% between 2010 and 2012 (from 8888 in 2010 to 16407 in 2012). But the vast majority of those are requests from local law enforcement looking for information about potential drug traffickers fraudsters and other domestic criminal activity.

Legally compelled NSA request relating to foreign terrorist targets which none of the firms are allowed to disclose are thought to represent a tiny fraction of the overall figure.

While the internet companies are listed by name in the NSA document the telecoms companies are hidden behind covernames.

The names of these ""corporate partners"" are so sensitive that they are classified as ""ECI"" – Exceptionally Controlled Information – a higher classification level than the Snowden documents cover. Artifice Lithium and Serenade are listed in other documents as covernames for SSO corporate partners while Steelknight is described as an NSA partner facility.

In a statement defending its surveillance programs the NSA said: ""What NSA does is collect the communications of targets of foreign intelligence value irrespective of the provider that carries them. US service provider communications make use of the same information superhighways as a variety of other commercial service providers.

""NSA must understand and take that into account in order to eliminate information that is not related to foreign intelligence.

""NSA works with a number of partners and allies in meeting its foreign-intelligence mission goals and in every case those operations comply with US law and with the applicable laws under which those partners and allies operate.""

UPDATE: Microsoft issued a further statement after publication of the Guardian's story. A spokesperson said: ""Microsoft only discloses customer data when served with valid legal orders and in June we published a complete view of the volume of orders we received from the US government.

""But it is clear that much more transparency is needed to help the companies and their customers understand these issues."""
_GOVT_SURV,Apr_23_2015_Surveillance_reform_bill_returns_with_concessions_to_NSA_on_data_collection.txt,"Modifications made on behalf of the National Security Agency have paved the way for the return of a major piece of surveillance reform legislation the Guardian has learned.

According to congressional sources the architects of the USA Freedom Act a bill that seeks to stop the NSA’s bulk collection of Americans’ phone records have agreed to grant the surveillance giant temporary abilities to continue monitoring foreign targets who enter the US while agents seek domestic warrants; and to permit the agency to do the same for domestic targets for whom it has a probable-cause warrant who subsequently travel overseas.

Both additions discussed for weeks but intensified in the past several days were described as measures to gain support from pro-surveillance legislators on the House intelligence committee. Another such gesture included in the bill unrelated to surveillance would increase the maximum penalty for people lending material support to terrorism from 15 years to 20. The concessions were said to have come on behalf of the NSA rather than from the NSA itself.

Advocates of the much-delayed USA Freedom Act now expect the bill to be reintroduced on Thursday ahead of a short congressional recess the culmination of nine weeks of backroom negotiations.

“We’re really really close” one said on condition of anonymity to discuss a deal that was not final.

After passing the House in May 2014 only to fail in the Senate six months later the USA Freedom Act reappears barely a month before the legal authority undergirding the bulk phone records collection as well as other warrantless FBI investigative tools the Patriot Act’s Section 215 expires.

Related: Senate Republicans block USA Freedom Act surveillance reform bill

The bill would trade the end of bulk domestic phone data collection for the retention of the rest of Section 215 through 2019. It is a controversial swap. Several privacy groups prefer a straight expiration while the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell a Kentucky Republican has introduced his own straight reauthorization of the provision including the retention of the phone records program that was exposed by the Guardian thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The House of Representatives’ version of the USA Freedom Act lost significant support from privacy groups after the intelligence agencies and their congressional supporters with the support of the Obama administration watered down its prohibitions on bulk collection and its transparency requirements.

Supporters believe the 2015 version is stronger than what the House passed last year and is the only surveillance reform with a chance of passage. They argue the latest model is closer to a version in the Senate sponsored by Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy that civil libertarians preferred. But the Guardian has not seen the final text including its definition of the root “specific selection term” that the government can collect something that privacy groups last year considered overly broad.

The expected return of the USA Freedom Act comes as the Obama administration is attempting to publicly rebrand its surveillance to make it more palatable to the public and critically tech-sector companies alienated by the Snowden revelations.

On Wednesday as McConnell introduced his attempted 215 reauthorization the director of national intelligence James Clapper declassified statistics that seemed to indicate a slight decline in the use of key surveillance powers. In 2014 an estimated 227 Americans were the subject of searches of business records permitted under Section 215 down from an estimated 248 in 2013 though the collection of those records often affects many more.

The defense secretary Ashton Carter who presides over the NSA and US Cyber Command will deliver an address to Stanford University on Thursday that is described as an effort to mend ties with Silicon Valley even as defense officials conceded the NSA played a large role in crafting the cybersecurity strategy that Carter will discuss.

Yet significant divides remain on surveillance between the administration and the privacy and tech communities many of whose members consider a cybersecurity bill passed on Wednesday by the House with tentative administration support to be little more than a surveillance bill under another name.

The Mozilla Foundation’s privacy chief Chris Riley denounced McConnell’s effort to retain bulk surveillance within his Section 215 reauthorization proposal.

“Our call records are more than just numbers and metadata they are intimate portraits into our lives and should be kept private. Mozilla and thousands of internet users urge Congress to pass real surveillance reform” Riley said in a statement."

WASHINGTON — The federal government has been secretly collecting information on foreigners overseas for nearly six years from the nation’s largest Internet companies like Google Facebook and most recently Apple in search of national security threats the director of national intelligence confirmed Thursday night.

The confirmation of the classified program came just hours after government officials acknowledged a separate seven-year effort to sweep up records of telephone calls inside the United States. Together the unfolding revelations opened a window into the growth of government surveillance that began under the Bush administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 2001 and has clearly been embraced and even expanded under the Obama administration.

Government officials defended the two surveillance initiatives as authorized under law known to Congress and necessary to guard the country against terrorist threats. But an array of civil liberties advocates and libertarian conservatives said the disclosures provided the most detailed confirmation yet of what has been long suspected about what the critics call an alarming and ever-widening surveillance state.

The Internet surveillance program collects data from online providers including e-mail chat services videos photos stored data file transfers video conferencing and log-ins according to classified documents obtained and posted by The Washington Post and then The Guardian on Thursday afternoon.

In confirming its existence officials said that the program called Prism is authorized under a foreign intelligence law that was recently renewed by Congress and maintained that it minimizes the collection and retention of information “incidentally acquired” about Americans and permanent residents. Several of the Internet companies said they did not allow the government open-ended access to their servers but complied with specific lawful requests for information.

“It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States” James Clapper the director of national intelligence said in a statement describing the law underlying the program. “Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.”

The Prism program grew out of the National Security Agency’s desire several years ago to begin addressing the agency’s need to keep up with the explosive growth of social media according to people familiar with the matter.

The dual revelations in rapid succession also suggested that someone with access to high-level intelligence secrets had decided to unveil them in the midst of furor over leak investigations. Both were reported by The Guardian while The Post relying upon the same presentation almost simultaneously reported the Internet company tapping. The Post said a disenchanted intelligence official provided it with the documents to expose government overreach.

Before the disclosure of the Internet company surveillance program on Thursday the White House and Congressional leaders defended the phone program saying it was legal and necessary to protect national security.

Josh Earnest a White House spokesman told reporters aboard Air Force One that the kind of surveillance at issue “has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terror threats as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities particularly people located inside the United States.” He added: “The president welcomes a discussion of the trade-offs between security and civil liberties.”

The Guardian and The Post posted several slides from the 41-page presentation about the Internet program listing the companies involved — which included Yahoo Microsoft Paltalk AOL Skype and YouTube — and the dates they joined the program as well as listing the types of information collected under the program.

The reports came as President Obama was traveling to meet President Xi Jinping of China at an estate in Southern California a meeting intended to address among other things complaints about Chinese cyberattacks and spying. Now that conversation will take place amid discussion of America’s own vast surveillance operations.

But while the administration and lawmakers who supported the telephone records program emphasized that all three branches of government had signed off on it Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union denounced the surveillance as an infringement of fundamental individual liberties no matter how many parts of the government approved of it.

“A pox on all the three houses of government” Mr. Romero said. “On Congress for legislating such powers on the FISA court for being such a paper tiger and rubber stamp and on the Obama administration for not being true to its values.”

Others raised concerns about whether the telephone program was effective.

Word of the program emerged when The Guardian posted an April order from the secret foreign intelligence court directing a subsidiary of Verizon Communications to give the N.S.A. “on an ongoing daily basis” until July logs of communications “between the United States and abroad” or “wholly within the United States including local telephone calls.”

On Thursday Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia the top Democrat and top Republican on the Intelligence Committee said the court order appeared to be a routine reauthorization as part of a broader program that lawmakers have long known about and supported.

“As far as I know this is an exact three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years” Ms. Feinstein said adding that it was carried out by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court “under the business records section of the Patriot Act.”

“Therefore it is lawful” she said. “It has been briefed to Congress.”

While refusing to confirm or to directly comment on the reported court order Verizon in an internal e-mail to employees defended its release of calling information to the N.S.A.

There is a lot to praise in the powerful ruling issued by a three-judge federal appeals panel in New York on Thursday which held that the government’s vast continuing and until recently secret sweep of Americans’ phone records is illegal.

But perhaps the most important message the unanimous decision sends is a simple one: Congress could not have intended to approve a program whose true scope almost no one outside the National Security Agency fully comprehended — that is until Edward Snowden leaked its details to the world.

In the nearly two years since those revelations shocked America and started a heated debate on the proper balance of privacy and national security the N.S.A. which conducts the data sweeps has defended its actions by contending that Congress knew exactly what it was doing when it reauthorized the Patriot Act in 2010 and 2011 after the collection program had begun.

At issue before the appeals panel was Section 215 of the act which permits the government to collect information that is “relevant” to terrorism investigations. But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court at the urging of the N.S.A. has interpreted “relevant” so broadly that it gives the government essentially unlimited power to collect all phone and other types of data.

In fighting this lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union immediately after the Snowden leaks the government argued that Congress was apparently fine with this alarmingly broad interpretation.

The problem as Judge Gerard Lynch of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals rightly pointed out in his 97-page opinion is that “it is a far stretch to say that Congress was aware” of what the intelligence court was doing. To the contrary Judge Lynch wrote “knowledge of the program was intentionally kept to a minimum both within Congress and among the public” and there was “no opportunity for broad discussion” about whether the court’s interpretation was correct. Allowing the government to define “relevant” so loosely he said “would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans.”

It is particularly galling that the government cannot even point to evidence that any terrorist attack has been thwarted by the collection of all this data. But even if it could the panel said “we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate and expressed in unmistakable language.”

For too long that debate did not happen nor could it since the intelligence court operated in near-total secrecy. Now thanks to Mr. Snowden (who still lives in exile in Russia) the debate is well underway and not a moment too soon since Congress is debating reauthorization of Section 215 which is scheduled to expire on June 1.

Bipartisan bills in both houses would amend the law to cut back on domestic phone-data sweeps but they do not address bulk collection of overseas calls which could include information about Americans and they do not establish an advocate to represent the public’s interest before the intelligence court.

Without such an advocate Judge Robert Sack wrote in a concurring opinion the court “may be subject to the understandable suspicion that hearing only from the government it is likely to be strongly inclined to rule for the government.”

Unfortunately even modest reforms face resistance from top Republicans including the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell who on Thursday called for the law to be renewed without change. In doing so they ignored a ruling that is the most important rebuke yet of the government’s abuses under that law."
_GOVT_SURV,Dec_27_2013_NSA_mass_collection_of_phone_data_is_legal_federal_judge_rules.txt,"A legal battle over the scope of US government surveillance took a turn in favour of the National Security Agency on Friday with a court opinion declaring that bulk collection of telephone data does not violate the constitution.

The judgement in a case brought before a district court in New York by the American Civil Liberties Union directly contradicts the result of a similar challenge in a Washington court last week which ruled the NSA's bulk collection program was likely to prove unconstitutional and was ""almost Orwellian"" in scale.

Friday's ruling makes it more likely that the issue will be settled by the US supreme court although it may be overtaken by the decision of Barack Obama on whether to accept the recommendations of a White House review panel to ban the NSA from directly collecting such data.

But the ruling from Judge William Pauley a Clinton appointee to the Southern District of New York will provide important ammunition for those within the intelligence community urging Obama to maintain the programme.

Judge Pauley said privacy protections enshrined in the fourth amendment of the US constitution needed to be balanced against a government need to maintain a database of records to prevent future terrorist attacks. “The right to be free from searches is fundamental but not absolute” he said. “Whether the fourth amendment protects bulk telephony metadata is ultimately a question of reasonableness.”

Pauley argued that al-Qaida's “bold jujitsu” strategy to marry seventh century ideology with 21st century technology made it imperative that government authorities be allowed to push privacy boundaries.

“As the September 11 attacks demonstrate the cost of missing such a threat can be horrific” he wrote in the ruling. “Technology allowed al-Qaida to operate decentralised and plot international terrorist attacks remotely. The bulk telephony metadata collection programme represents the government's counter-punch: connecting fragmented and fleeting communications to re-construct and eliminate al-Qaida's terror network.”

The ACLU case against the NSA was dismissed primarily on the grounds that bulk collection was authorised under existing laws allowing “relevant” data collection to be authorised by secret US courts.

Judge Pauley took a more sympathetic view of this relevance standard than many lawmakers in Congress although he acknowledged it was “problematic” that many were not aware of how widely the law was being interpreted before disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

“The ACLU argues that the category at issue – all telephony metadata – is too broad and contains too much irrelevant information. That argument has no traction here. Because without all the data points the government cannot be certain it is connecting the pertinent ones” said Pauley.

“There is no way for the government to know which particle of telephony metadata will lead to useful counterterrorism information ... Armed with all the metadata NSA can draw connections it might otherwise never be able to find. The collection is broad but the scope of counterterrorism investigations is unprecedented.”

The ACLU said it would appeal the decision starting in the New York circuit. “We are extremely disappointed with this decision which misinterprets the relevant statutes understates the privacy implications of the government’s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections” said Jameel Jaffer ACLU deputy legal director.

“As another federal judge and the President’s own review group concluded last week the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of telephony data constitutes a serious invasion of Americans’ privacy. We intend to appeal and look forward to making our case in the second circuit.”

Judge Pauley said his ruling did not mean it was right to continue with the program which he acknowledged was a “blunt tool” that “imperils the civil liberties of every citizen” if unchecked. “While robust discussions are under way across the nation in Congress and at the White House the question for this court is whether the government's bulk telephony metadata program is lawful. The court finds it is” he wrote. “But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide.”"

WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday partly blocked the National Security Agency’s program that systematically collects Americans’ domestic phone records in bulk just weeks before the agency was scheduled to shut it down and replace it. The judge said the program was most likely unconstitutional.

In a separate case challenging the program a federal appeals court in New York on Oct. 30 had declined to weigh in on the constitutional issues saying it would be imprudent to interfere with an orderly transition to a replacement system after Nov. 29.

But on Monday in a 43-page ruling Judge Richard J. Leon of United States District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that the constitutional issues were too important to leave unanswered in the history of the program which traces back to after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and came to light in 2013 in leaks by Edward J. Snowden the former intelligence contractor.

“With the government’s authority to operate the bulk telephony metadata program quickly coming to an end this case is perhaps the last chapter in the judiciary’s evaluation of this particular program’s compatibility with the Constitution” he wrote. “It will not however be the last chapter in the ongoing struggle to balance privacy rights and national security interests under our Constitution in an age of evolving technological wizardry.”

Under the program the N.S.A. has been collecting Americans’ phone records in bulk from telephone companies. It uses the data to analyze social links between people to hunt for hidden associates of terrorism suspects.

Judge Leon specifically ordered the N.S.A. to stop collecting phone records for one customer of Verizon: a lawyer in California and his law firm. But he did so he wrote knowing that the Justice Department had said that blocking the collection of just one person’s records might require shutting down the entire program because it would be technically difficult to screen him out.

The Justice Department said it was reviewing the decision but had no comment about whether it would appeal the injunction. Reuters reported on Monday that the N.S.A. had sent a memo to Congress saying that testing of the replacement system had begun.

The program began based on a unilateral claim of executive power by President George W. Bush. In 2006 the Justice Department persuaded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to begin issuing orders for the program under an interpretation of a provision of the U.S.A. Patriot Act that permits collection of business records relevant to a national-security investigation.

In June 2013 Mr. Snowden leaked one such order to a subsidiary of Verizon. After substantial debate Congress in June enacted the U.S.A. Freedom Act which banned bulk collection under the Patriot Act after Nov. 29 and established a system under which the bulk data will stay with the phone companies but the N.S.A. can swiftly access it.

Revelations of the program set off lawsuits challenging it as illegal on statutory and constitutional grounds. In December 2013 Judge Leon ruled that it was most likely unconstitutional but issued no order permitting the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review his ruling.

But a week later in a different case a federal judge in New York ruled that the program was legal. The federal appeals court in New York eventually ruled that the program was not based on a legitimate interpretation of the Patriot Act but sidestepped the constitutional question.

Judge Leon’s ruling that the bulk collection of calling records most likely violated the Constitution was novel because in 1979 the Supreme Court held that call logs or metadata — records showing who called whom and when but not the content of what they said — was not protected by the Fourth Amendment.

Its ruling turned on the notion that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy for information they reveal to a third party and they expose whom they are calling to phone companies. That case however involved one criminal suspect’s calls over several days not call records of everyone in the country and the storage of them for five years.

Judge Leon argued that changing technological capabilities had brought call records into the ambit of Fourth Amendment protections. But last summer an appeals court overturned his ruling on a technicality: There was not enough evidence that the plaintiffs in the case — including Larry Klayman the conservative legal activist — had their calls collected by the program. Mr. Klayman was a not a customer of the Verizon subsidiary in the order Mr. Snowden leaked.

The appeals court sent the case back to Judge Leon who suggested to Mr. Klayman that he add a plaintiff who was a customer of the Verizon subsidiary. He did so: J.J. Little a trial lawyer in California and his law firm.

Judge Leon issued the injunction on Monday for Mr. Little’s records not Mr. Klayman’s."
_GOVT_SURV,Jun_12_2013_3_Tech_Giants_Want_to_Reveal_Data_Requests.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google Facebook and Microsoft on Tuesday asked the government for permission to reveal details about the classified requests they receive for the personal information of foreign users.

They made the request after revelations about the National Security Agency’s secret Internet surveillance program known as Prism for collecting data from technology companies like e-mail messages photos stored documents videos and online chats. The collection is legally authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which forbids companies from acknowledging the existence of requests or revealing any details about them.

Google for the first time publicly acknowledged it had received FISA requests and said it had complied with far fewer of the requests than it received. Facebook and Microsoft did not go as far as discussing requests they had received but like Google said they wanted to be able to publish information on the volume and scope of the government requests.

Christopher Soghoian a senior policy analyst studying privacy technology and surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union said that while he appreciated the statements from the companies they were largely meant to save face with users and employees.

“If nothing else happens this is a way of putting the government on the defensive and shifting the blame from the companies to the government” he said.

Many questions remain unanswered after the leak of N.S.A. documents about Prism including precisely how the tech companies and the government cooperate. Prism refers to an automated system for electronically exchanging information regarding FISA requests according to people briefed on how it works. On Tuesday David Drummond Google’s chief legal officer said in an interview on British television that Google hands over the information to the government in person or by using a file-transferring technology called secure FTP.

But the companies say they are frustrated that they are unable because of a government gag order to give more details of sharing user data with the government.

That gap in information has fed speculation that is untrue Mr. Drummond wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Eric H. Holder Jr. the attorney general and Robert S. Mueller the director of the F.B.I. In the letter Mr. Drummond asked for permission to publish both the number of national security requests including FISA disclosures that Google receives and their scope.

“Google’s numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made” Mr. Drummond wrote. “Google has nothing to hide.” Mr. Drummond was unavailable for an interview.

In a statement Leslie Miller a Google spokeswoman said “only a tiny fraction” of Google’s hundreds of millions of users worldwide were subject to government data requests each year.

Google has said it scrutinizes each government request and narrows the scope if it is overly broad. In 2010 it became the first major tech company to publish a transparency report detailing certain government requests for user information. In March after long negotiations with law enforcement it added national security letters which the F.B.I. uses to ask for information and which companies are generally not permitted to disclose. Still Google was allowed to report only that it received zero to 999 such letters.

Microsoft released its first transparency report in March. The company said on Thursday that the report went as far as it legally could and urged the government to allow it to publish more information.

Facebook has never published a transparency report despite pressure to do so. On Thursday it said it would start publishing one if the government gave it permission to release information on the size and scope of national security requests.

“We have questioned the value of releasing a transparency report that because of exactly these types of government restrictions on disclosure is necessarily incomplete and therefore potentially misleading to users” Ted Ullyot Facebook’s general counsel said in a statement."
_GOVT_SURV,Apr_26_2014_Phone_Company_Bid_to_Keep_Data_From_N.S.A._Is_Rejected.txt,"WASHINGTON — A telephone company asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in January to stop requiring it to give records of its customers’ calls to the National Security Agency in light of a ruling by a Federal District Court judge that the N.S.A. program is likely unconstitutional according to court papers declassified on Friday.

But Judge Rosemary M. Collyer another Federal District Court judge who also sits on the secret surveillance court rejected the request — and her colleague’s legal analysis — in a 31-page ruling on March 20 the newly declassified papers show. The identity of the phone company was censored in the documents that were made public.

The developments heighten the display of legal tensions over the program. Since 2006 a series of judges on the secret surveillance court have repeatedly ordered companies to participate in the program but none of them produced a judicial opinion explaining why it was legally justified until after it became public in the leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden.

Since then some outsiders have challenged the legality of the bulk records collection. The critics include Judge Richard J. Leon who ruled in December that the program was likely to violate the Fourth Amendment. Judges Collyer and Leon were both appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 for the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.

On Jan. 22 the unnamed phone company asked the surveillance court to vacate the current order requiring it to turn over customers’ records in light of Judge Leon’s ruling. But Judge Collyer said she found Judge Leon’s analysis to be “unpersuasive.”

The argument chiefly focused on Smith v. Maryland a 1979 case in which the Supreme Court held that there was no Fourth Amendment protections for metadata — information like the numbers dialed and the duration of a call but not its contents. Judge Leon argued that the precedent was not valid when applied to bulk collection of all Americans’ phone data in the modern era. But Judge Collyer said the Supreme Court precedent was still valid and that the bulk nature of the collection was irrelevant because what mattered was each individual caller’s expectation of privacy.

Separately the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board has issued a lengthy analysis rejecting the surveillance court’s view that a provision of the Patriot Act — which allows the F.B.I. to obtain business records that are relevant to an investigation — can be legitimately interpreted as authorizing bulk collection. The board issued its report after the phone company made its challenge and neither it nor Judge Collyer’s ruling addressed that issue.

In another lawsuit Judge William H. Pauley III of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York upheld the program in December. Before the program’s public disclosure Judge Pauley — who is also not on the surveillance court — had been briefed on the program and rejected Freedom of Information Act lawsuits by The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union seeking details about how the government was interpreting the Patriot Act."

The federal government was so determined to collect the Internet communications of foreign Yahoo customers in 2008 that it threatened the company with fines of $250000 a day if it did not immediately comply with a secret court order to turn over the data.

The threat — which was made public Thursday as part of about 1500 pages of previously classified documents that were unsealed by a federal court — adds new details to the public history of a fight that unfolded in secret at the time as Yahoo challenged the constitutionality of a statute that legalized a form of the Bush administration’s program of warrantless surveillance of foreigners — and lost. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act companies that receive data requests are prohibited by law from talking about the substance of specific requests or even acknowledging they occurred.

Yahoo’s 2008 challenge to the warrantless surveillance law and an appeals court’s rejection of that challenge were first reported by The New York Times last year shortly after Edward J. Snowden a former National Security Agency contractor exposed a more extensive government surveillance program called Prism through classified documents leaked to The Washington Post and The Guardian.

The documents released on Thursday show that the government expected Internet providers to begin complying with orders under the law — which Congress later replaced with another statute called the FISA Amendments Act — before the intelligence court had approved the procedures for targeting specific accounts and protecting any private information about Americans collected incidentally in the course of the warrantless surveillance aimed at people abroad.

The records also provide perhaps the clearest corroboration yet of the Internet companies’ contention that they did not provide the government with direct access to vast amounts of customer data on their computers.

When the Snowden revelations surfaced last summer there were reports that the government had direct access to look into the databases of Internet companies for any information they wanted which the companies have denied. Instead they said the government had to send them a lawful request for information on a specific individual and only then would they hand it over.

In a document reporting on its compliance with the 2008 order to turn over customer data Yahoo said it had begun surveillance on the requested accounts beginning with the government’s highest-priority targets. That indicates that the government was sending Yahoo the names of the people it was investigating and waiting for the company to send the information as opposed to directly accessing Yahoo’s servers.

Over all the cache of documents shows how Yahoo fought the government and eventually lost its appeal. That helped set the stage for a vast expansion of the federal government’s surveillance of Internet users through the secret Prism program. Ultimately Yahoo and seven other companies had to give data to the government under the program.

Yahoo described the government’s threat to seek fines in a blog post on Thursday. A Yahoo spokesman further explained that the court ordered it to comply while its appeal was pending.

Proceedings in front of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are usually secret and Yahoo had been pressing for months for the declassification and release of the documents.

“We consider this an important win for transparency and hope that these records help promote informed discussion about the relationship between privacy due process and intelligence gathering” Ron Bell Yahoo’s general counsel wrote in the blog post.

The Justice Department has posted many of the documents online and Yahoo said it would work to make more of them available to the public.

Yahoo brought its challenge after the 2007 enactment of the Protect America Act which gave the first temporary legalization to a form of the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program. It authorized the government to collect from domestic networks and providers the communications of people thought to be located abroad.

In 2008 the Protect America Act expired and Congress replaced it with the FISA Amendments Act which reauthorized a more permanent version of the program. The 2008 law extended some protections for Americans abroad — an issue Yahoo had concerns about — by limiting the targets of the warrantless surveillance to noncitizens abroad.

While Yahoo’s challenge was technically to the Protect America Act however most of its concerns applied equally to the FISA Amendments Act. The rulings by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its review panel upholding the Protect America Act became an important though secret precedent for the constitutionality of expansive government surveillance powers.

Yahoo did not seek Supreme Court review of the issue. One complication the Yahoo spokesman noted was that the Protect America Act had expired and such a challenge might have had to start over again addressing the FISA Amendments Act. The spokesman did not say how much the litigation had cost but said it was considerable.

In 2012 Congress reauthorized the FISA Amendments Act and that same year a constitutional challenge to the law brought by Amnesty International and other plaintiffs reached the Supreme Court. But the justices dismissed the case without examining the merits on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not prove they had been wiretapped and so lacked standing.

Yahoo’s only victory was that the intelligence courts agreed that it had standing to file a challenge on behalf of its users rejecting the Bush administration’s argument that it could not raise the concerns in court the newly disclosed documents show.

The American Civil Liberties Union praised the court’s decision to release the documents.

“Yahoo should be lauded for standing up to sweeping government demands for its customers’ private data” Patrick C. Toomey a staff lawyer at the group said in a statement. “But today’s release only underscores the need for basic structural reforms to bring transparency to the NSA’s surveillance activities.”"
_GOVT_SURV,Jul__7_2016_Fifteen_secret_warrants_in_force_granting_bulk_data_collection_in_UK.txt,"There are 15 secret “directions” in force under the Telecommunications Act enabling the intelligence services to collect bulk data about online and phone traffic a surveillance watchdog has revealed.

The number of orders imposed on telephone and internet companies under section 94 of the 1984 legislation has been published for the first time by the interception of communications commissioner’s office (IOCCO). The firms involved have not been identified.



A further eight directions have been made to provide for emergency services and to protect security personnel according to a report on the operation of the rarely disclosed powers.

Parliament does not have to be notified of section 94 directions and until last year they were not subject to formal oversight from any watchdog. Their operation will be reorganised under the investigatory powers bill although the IOCCO is pressing for stronger oversight of bulk communications data collection.

Related: Snooper's charter: GCHQ will be licensed 'to hack a major town'

The 15 directions or warrants relate to traffic data subscriber and service user information acquired by the government’s monitoring agency GCHQ and the national security service MI5. They do not include the content of calls or emails.

Any secretary of state can sign a secret section 94 direction. Their use was so poorly recorded within Whitehall the IOCCO said that it was difficult to be sure it could account for every one ever issued.

Sir Stanley Burnton the commissioner said: “The review of section 94 has been extremely challenging. Our report highlights clearly the difficulties when statutes are operated in secret and without codified statutory procedures.



“We make extensive recommendations that the intelligence and law enforcement agencies must implement to clarify and bring consistency to their procedures to remedy the lack of record-keeping requirements and to ensure that we can oversee properly how section 94 directions are given and used.”

Telephone and internet service companies have to comply with the orders and cannot reveal their existence. Directions are not time limited.



The report notes: “It is not an exaggeration to say that the lack of codified procedures made it challenging for us to piece together and determine historically what section 94 notices had been given by whom and when which ones had been modified and whether they were still extant or not.”

There are other section 94 orders that do not fall within the scope of the watchdog including some relating to Ofcom and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.

The report shows that some service providers subject to bulk collection orders were worried about publicity and whether information would be shared with foreign intelligence agencies.

Some of the public electronic communications networks (PECNs) the watchdog said raised concerns “relating to reputational [and commercial] risks”. Others worried about whether bulk communications data they had disclosed had been shared with agencies in other jurisdictions. “In one case a PECN had asked the agency to ensure that this did not happen and we were able to confirm that their data had not been shared with another jurisdiction” the report says.

It revealed that in 2015 GCHQ “identified 141251 communications addresses or identifiers of interest from communications data acquired in bulk pursuant to section 94 directions which directly contributed to an intelligence report”.

In the same year MI5 “made 20042 applications to access communications data obtained pursuant to section 94 directions. These applications related to 122579 items of communications data.”

Millie Graham Wood a legal officer at the campaign group Privacy International said the report was “a damning verdict of the government and intelligence agencies’ use of very vague powers as a justification of mass surveillance of innocent people”.

She said it was “shocking and unacceptable” that there had never been a public or parliamentary debate about the use of the powers and that rigorous oversight was vital. .

“Section 94 is tucked away in the ‘miscellaneous’ provisions of the 1984 Telecommunications Act and provides a very broad power to any secretary of state to give secret directions to any provider of a public electronic communications network. Communications providers can be instructed ‘to do or not to do’ anything specified and the direction does not automatically expire.

“The agencies have used this vague power to demand our internet and telephone network providers hand over huge swaths of our personal data. The intelligence agencies tell us that they need this data to conduct targeted searches however in 2015 GCHQ and MI5 searched bulk communications data databases for 263830 communication addresses or identifiers. This is hardly looking for the needle in the haystack. We need robust oversight and a transparent authorisation process for access to data.”"
_GOVT_SURV,Jul_31_2013_XKeyscore:_NSA_tool_collects_'nearly_everything_a_user_does_on_the_internet'.txt,"A top secret National Security Agency program allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals according to documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The NSA boasts in training materials that the program called XKeyscore is its ""widest-reaching"" system for developing intelligence from the internet.

The latest revelations will add to the intense public and congressional debate around the extent of NSA surveillance programs. They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight.

The files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10.

""I sitting at my desk"" said Snowden could ""wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge or even the president if I had a personal email"".

US officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee said of Snowden's assertion: ""He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.""

But training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.

XKeyscore the documents boast is the NSA's ""widest reaching"" system developing intelligence from computer networks – what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers ""nearly everything a typical user does on the internet"" including the content of emails websites visited and searches as well as their metadata.

Analysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing ""real-time"" interception of an individual's internet activity.

Under US law the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person' though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability if not the legal authority to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information such as their email or IP address is known to the analyst.

One training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.

The purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity such as browser history even when there is no known email account (a ""selector"" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.

Analysts can also search by name telephone number IP address keywords the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.

One document notes that this is because ""strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability"" because ""a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.""

The NSA documents assert that by 2008 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.

Analysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.

A slide entitled ""plug-ins"" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes ""every email address seen in a session by both username and domain"" ""every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)"" and user activity – ""the webmail and chat activity to include username buddylist machine specific cookies etc"".

Email monitoring

In a second Guardian interview in June Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.

One top-secret document describes how the program ""searches within bodies of emails webpages and documents"" including the ""To From CC BCC lines"" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites"".

To search for emails an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form along with the ""justification"" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.

KS3edit2 Photograph: Guardian

The analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.

The system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select including as one NSA document put it ""communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States"".

One document a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:

Chats browsing history and other internet activity

Beyond emails the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities including those within social media.

An NSA tool called DNI Presenter used to read the content of stored emails also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.

KS55edit Photograph: Guardian

An analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.

KS6 Photograph: Guardian

Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.

KS7 Photograph: Guardian

As one slide indicates the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls ""nearly everything a typical user does on the internet"".

KS8 Photograph: Guardian

The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.

KS9 Photograph: Guardian

The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn ""call events"" collected and stored in the NSA databases and close to 150bn internet records. Each day the document says 1-2bn records were added.

William Binney a former NSA mathematician said last year that the agency had ""assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens"" an estimate he said that ""only was involving phone calls and emails"". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that ""every day collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails phone calls and other type of communications.""

The XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: ""At some sites the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.""

To solve this problem the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store ""interesting"" content in other databases such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years.

It is the databases of XKeyscore one document shows that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.

In 2012 there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.

Legal v technical restrictions

While the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.

The ACLU's deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.

""The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications"" said Jaffer. ""The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans"" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.

An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt Amsterdam and New York.

In recent years the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.

Moreover all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications making them readily searchable without warrants.

Some searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. ""It's very rare to be questioned on our searches"" Snowden told the Guardian in June ""and even when we are it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.""

In a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.

Acknowledging what he called ""a number of compliance problems"" Clapper attributed them to ""human error"" or ""highly sophisticated technology issues"" rather than ""bad faith"".

However Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: ""These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community and are troubling.""

In a statement to the Guardian the NSA said: ""NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against – and only against – legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.

""XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.

""Allegations of widespread unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore as well as all of NSA's analytic tools is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks … In addition there are multiple technical manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.""

""Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable to ensure that they are proper and within the law.

""These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad."""
_GOVT_SURV,Feb__7_2015_British_Court_Says_Spying_on_Data_Was_Illegal.txt,"LONDON — The court that oversees intelligence agencies in Britain ruled on Friday that the electronic mass surveillance of cellphone and other online communications data had been conducted unlawfully.

The legal decision the first time the court has ruled against the British intelligence services since the tribunal was created in 2000 relates to information that was shared between British security agencies and the National Security Agency of the United States before December 2014.

Although privacy campaigners claimed the decision as a victory many experts said the British and American intelligence agencies would continue to share information obtained with electronic surveillance even if they had to slightly alter their techniques to comply with human rights law.

“It’s a real landmark case” said Ian Brown a professor of information security and privacy at the University of Oxford. “This will not stop intelligence agencies from sharing information. But it’s unlikely they will be able to conduct large-scale uncontrolled intelligence activities without more oversight.”

Over the past decade British and American intelligence agencies have used a program known as Prism — first revealed by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden — and others like it to gain access to individuals’ Internet communications without their knowledge.

The British court found however that Government Communications Headquarters a British intelligence agency known as GCHQ had unlawfully retrieved information gathered from American surveillance programs before the end of 2014. The agency the court said had broken European human rights law because there was not enough oversight regarding the way in which the information had been collected from American agencies.

“For far too long intelligence agencies like GCHQ and N.S.A. have acted like they are above the law” said Eric King deputy director of Privacy International one of several privacy advocacy groups that brought the case. “Over the past decade GCHQ and the N.S.A. have been engaged in an illegal mass surveillance sharing program that has affected millions of people around the world.”

The same court however ruled last year that American and British intelligence agencies could continue to lawfully share information because the oversight of the data-collection program had been brought into compliance with European law.

The British intelligence agency however dismissed the claims from the privacy advocates saying that the court’s ruling would allow the vast surveillance techniques to continue.

“We are pleased that the court has once again ruled that the U.K.’s bulk interception regime is fully lawful” the agency said on Friday in a statement referring to the December ruling that allowed the surveillance programs to continue. “By its nature much of GCHQ’s work must remain secret. But we are working with the rest of government to improve public understanding about what we do.”

A number of privacy advocates and rights groups including Amnesty International filed the case against the British intelligence agency in 2013 after information about the covert surveillance programs were first revealed by Mr. Snowden.

During the court’s hearings many of the GCHQ’s techniques including malware that allowed the British government to turn on computer microphones and cameras without the owners’ knowledge were first made public.

The privacy groups have appealed the British court’s December ruling which allowed for American and British intelligence agencies to continue sharing surveillance materials.

The appeal which will be heard by the end of the year at the earliest has been sent to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg France. The ruling means that individuals both in Britain and potentially abroad who believe they may have been targeted before December 2014 can petition the court to see what information the British intelligence agency may have collected on them."

In the post-Snowden era tech companies are increasingly being rated not only for the quality of their gadgets and services but also for how they handle government requests for customer data. In the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s annual report on data collection practices tech companies like Yahoo Apple and Adobe earned top marks while WhatsApp and AT&T came in last.

The report this week from the E.F.F. a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights evaluated companies based on factors including their transparency to consumers about data requests and data retention as well as their public positions on so-called back doors that grant government agencies access to customer data.

Apple Adobe Yahoo Dropbox and Sonic.net were among those that scored highly. AT&T and WhatsApp which earned the lowest marks with one out of five stars did not immediately have comments. Verizon Communications which earned two stars in the report (down from four stars last year when the report had slightly different criteria) declined to comment.

The wide-ranging nature of government surveillance programs many of which have been revealed by documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden the former National Security Agency contractor put pressure on tech companies to be more proactive about sharing their data collection and disclosure practices.

Most tech companies have published so-called transparency reports detailing the number of requests they receive from government agencies while also describing the types of data they collect and share. A number of big tech companies including Facebook Google Apple and Microsoft have urged President Obama to reject policies aiming to weaken encryption technologies that protect Internet communications.

The broad conclusion from the E.F.F.’s report is that the tech sector’s data practices are broadly improving. When the nonprofit group began publishing the report called “Who has your back?” in 2011 virtually every company on the list had a low score."
_GOVT_SURV,Jul_20_2013_Surveillance_Court_Renews_Order_for_Phone_Call_Data.txt,The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has approved a new order for collection of bulk data on phone calls in the United States allowing the National Security Agency to continue a practice that has been criticized by some members of Congress and the public. In a statement Friday the office of the director of national intelligence announced that the court which operates largely in secret had permitted the N.S.A. to continue to collect phone logs which do not include the actual contents of the calls. The original order disclosed last month by Edward J. Snowden an N.S.A. contractor expired Friday.
_GOVT_SURV,Apr_23_2014_Legal_community_has_‘grave_concerns’_over_new_push_for_mass_data_collection.txt,"The Law Council of Australia says there are “grave concerns” within Australia’s legal community about a renewed push by police and intelligence agencies to require telecommunications companies to store their customer’s private data for two years or more.



Phillip Boulten from the Law Council’s national criminal law committee said on Wednesday that law enforcement and Australia’s peak intelligence organisation Asio had sought significant extensions to domestic surveillance powers over the past decade and further reforms should be rebuffed unless they were “necessary and proportionate”.

Boulten said some lawyers feared that the privacy of ordinary citizens could be breached in a mass storage exercise.

“There’s great concern in the legal profession about that proposal” Boulten told a Senate inquiry into Australia’s telecommunications interception regime. “There are grave concerns that holding that sort of data for say two years will seriously jeopardise privacy concerns and lead to extraordinary costs for internet service providers.”

He also pointed to a recent decision by Europe’s highest court to strike down the data retention regime in the EU on the basis it breached human rights law. The European regime operated much like the current proposal being sought by Australian agencies – that phone companies be required to store private data on their customers for two years whether or not people are persons of interest.

Boulten said the court had acted in Europe specifically because of the “risk of abuse”.

He also raised practical issues about the storage of data querying how the proposed regime would be enforced in Australia if key information was stored by telcos in “clouds” outside the country.

Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are using the current senate inquiry triggered by disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden to press for mandatory data retention. “Without it we will be fighting organised crime not with one arm tied behind our backs but with two” the acting chief executive of the Australian Crime Commission Paul Jevtovic told the inquiry on Tuesday.

Jevtovic’s point was criminals are using developments in technology to remain ahead of detection efforts by law enforcement and the current Australian interception regime is not keeping pace with the requirements of agencies to both access and share data in cooperative investigations into terrorism and organised crime.

The Abbott government is yet to signal whether it will give agencies what they are seeking on mandatory data retention but the opposition signalled recently it was willing to revive the proposal which was shelved under the Gillard government before the September election because it was too controversial.

But the Law Council was one of several groups who used Wednesday’s hearing to raise concerns about data retention. The Internet Society of Australia president Narelle Clark told the hearing two to five years was “too long to retain this type of data.”

Clark said before there was any move to mandatory data retention there needed to be a clear discussion about technology standards and effective oversight. “None of that is in evidence at this point in time.”

The Commonwealth Ombudsman used Wednesday’s hearing to argue it should have greater scope to monitor “metadata” requests by agencies. Metadata is the information we all generate whenever we use technology from the date and time of a phone call to the location from which an email is sent.

Metadata can provide investigators with a substantial map of a person’s movements relationships and interactions. But the Ombudsman told the inquiry it had no scope to monitor metadata activity by law enforcement because it was a warrantless regime.

The intelligence watchdog the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) also appeared at Wednesday’s hearing. Vivienne Thom told the committee that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) maintained high standards and tight procedures.

She said there were occasions where telecommunications companies had given Asio the wrong data during investigations – but she quantified this as fewer than 10 times annually. She said Asio always made efforts to quarantine the wrongly obtained information and prevent officers accessing it. “The procedures are very good in my opinion” Thom told the inquiry.

Asio does not disclose publicly how many warrants it issues as part of its investigations so it is not possible to contextualise the information Thom gave the committee. Jake Blight from the IGIS declined to give specifics but he told the committee that data requests and warrant requests by Asio had been roughly stable over the past three years.

Blight also told the committee the IGIS provided oversight of all the intelligence agencies not just Asio. He was asked by Green senator Scott Ludlam about “seamless” intelligence cooperation between Australia and its 5-Eyes partners – the US Britain Canada New Zealand.

Ludlam wanted to know whether foreign agencies could circumvent Australian privacy protections through intelligence sharing. He said the Snowden disclosures had raised issues of concern.

Guardian Australia reported last December the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) offered in 2008 to share information collected about ordinary Australian citizens with its major intelligence partners. Legal experts suggested that action if followed through would see ASD operating outside its legal mandate.

Blight responded with a hypothetical telling Ludlam if the ASD asked a foreign agency to get material about Australian citizens it could not access under Australian law the IGIS would know about it and flag it in its annual report. “We would regard that as a breach of our legislation and report accordingly.”

“The data sharing about Australian persons is tightly regulated. It is subject to quite strict oversight. The privacy rules apply to ASD no matter where it operates” Blight said.

Thom also urged caution about any changes to the warrants regime that would limit oversight of Asio."

WASHINGTON — A little-known provision of the Patriot Act overlooked by lawmakers and administration officials alike appears to give President Obama a possible way to keep the National Security Agency’s bulk phone records program going indefinitely — even if Congress allows the law on which it is based to expire next year.

Senate Republicans on Tuesday night used a filibuster to block consideration of a bill to end and replace the N.S.A. phone records program. The debate about what may happen next has played out based on a widely held premise: that the legal basis for the program Section 215 of the Patriot Act will expire on June 1 so if Congress remains gridlocked the program will automatically shut down.

“I believe that if we do not pass this bill the metadata program is at risk because the 215 program sunsets next year” Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California said in Tuesday night’s debate. But that premise may be incorrect. If the summer arrives and the program is facing a shutdown Mr. Obama could invoke the provision to ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to keep it going.

Several executive branch officials said the administration had not been studying that option and expressed doubt that Mr. Obama would take such a step or that the Surveillance Court would agree to it if he tried. Still the mere existence of a potential way for the program to keep going without congressional action could recast the debate.

Among other things it could dampen any sense of solace felt by privacy advocates who supported the bill the U.S.A. Freedom Act and its revisions of the bulk data program but who believed that if Congress remained gridlocked the program was certain to disappear.

And it potentially transforms the politics of what could happen if the expiration date is reached without new legislation giving congressional Republicans a way to try to shift the blame for any risk created by letting the program lapse to Mr. Obama if the president does not use the provision to try to keep it going.

The law says that Section 215 along with another section of the Patriot Act expires on “June 1 2015 except that former provisions continue in effect with respect to any particular foreign intelligence investigation that began before June 1 2015 or with respect to any particular offense or potential offense that began or occurred before June 1 2015.”

Michael Davidson who until his retirement in 2011 was the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top staff lawyer said this meant that as long as there was an older counterterrorism investigation still open the court could keep issuing Section 215 orders to phone companies indefinitely for that investigation.

“It was always understood that no investigation should be different the day after the sunset than it was the day before” Mr. Davidson said adding: “There are important reasons for Congress to legislate on what if any program is now warranted. But considering the actual language of the sunset provision no one should believe the present program will disappear solely because of the sunset.”

Mr. Davidson said the widespread assumption by lawmakers and executive branch officials as well as in news articles in The New York Times and elsewhere that the program must lapse next summer without new legislation was incorrect.

The exception is obscure because it was recorded as a note accompanying Section 215; while still law it does not receive its own listing in the United States Code. It was created by the original Patriot Act and was explicitly restated in a 2006 reauthorization bill and then quietly carried forward in 2010 and in 2011.

Jameel Jaffer a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union which has brought one of several lawsuits against the government challenging the program said it would be “perverse” to interpret the exception as permitting the government to “bootstrap itself into permanent Section 215 authority.” He argued that Congress did not intend for the concept of “investigation” to mean an all-encompassing unending investigation into Al Qaeda because that would defeat the purpose of giving the provision an expiration date.

Still the F.B.I. has numerous open counterterrorism investigations. Officials have suggested that those include not just regular cases on particular suspects but open-ended “enterprise” investigations targeting entire organizations deemed to pose a serious threat to the public like Al Qaeda for wide-ranging examinations that continue for years.

Mr. Davidson said he was recently reminded of the exception while researching the Patriot Act for a friend-of-the court brief he co-wrote on behalf of the Center for National Security Studies for another lawsuit against the program arguing that Section 215 cannot be legitimately interpreted as authorizing bulk phone-data collection.

The White House press office said the administration would study the provision and was not ready to comment about it but provided a statement expressing disappointment that the bill had failed. It repeated that the program faced expiration.

“Going forward we will work with Congress to formulate and pass legislation that strikes a similar balance” the statement said. “We recognize the importance of doing so urgently — but carefully — given the impending June expiration of important national security tools.”

Mr. Obama’s views on the N.S.A. phone records program are ambiguous. In a January speech he extolled the program’s abilities as necessary and valuable but also said he agreed with critics that it risked abuse to let the government collect and store records of everyone’s phone calls. He embraced what became the U.S.A. Freedom Act — under which the bulk records would stay with the phone companies and a new kind of court order would permit the government to swiftly collect only those linked up to two callers away to specific suspects — as a way to solve the problem without losing the ability to analyze links between callers in the hunt for terrorists.

“I believe we need a new approach” he said. “I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk metadata.”

But Mr. Obama’s stance left unclear what he would do if faced with a different choice between permitting the government to keep holding the bulk records or losing the program’s abilities.

The Senate’s refusal to take up the bill also disappointed a coalition of technology companies that supported a provision that would have given them greater latitude to disclose information about surveillance orders they receive. In a statement on Wednesday they said they would continue to work for “meaningful reforms” in Congress."
_GOVT_SURV,Mar_25_2014_Obama:_US_must_'win_back_the_trust_of_ordinary_citizens'_over_data_collection.txt,"Barack Obama confirmed on Tuesday that the US plans to end the National Security Agency's systematic collection of Americans’ telephone records as leaders of a key committee in Congress insisted they were close to a deal with the White House to revamp the surveillance program.

Under plans to be put forward by the Obama administration in the next few days the NSA would end the so-called bulk collection of telephone records and instead would be required to seek a new kind of court order to search data held by telecommunications companies.

The proposals come nine months after the practice was first disclosed by the Guardian based on leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Obama conceded that the revelations had caused trust in the US to plunge around the world.

“We have got to win back the trust not just of governments but more importantly of ordinary citizens. And that's not going to happen overnight because there's a tendency to be sceptical of government and to be sceptical of the US intelligence services” Obama said at a news conference in The Hague where world leaders are gathered for a summit on nuclear security.

Obama said he believed the reform proposals presented to him by the US intelligence agencies were “workable” and would “eliminate” the concerns of privacy campaigners. “I am confident that it allows us to do what is necessary in order to deal the threat of a terrorist attack but does so in a way that addresses people's concerns” he said.

Activists gave a cautious welcome to Obama's plans. Jameel Jaffer the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in an article for the Guardian: “The president is acknowledging that a surveillance program endorsed by all three branches of government and in place for more than a decade has not been able to survive public scrutiny. It's an acknowledgement that the intelligence agencies the surveillance court and the intelligence committees struck a balance behind closed doors that could not be defended in public.”

In a statement through the ACLU Snowden said he had always believed that the NSA's ""unconstitutional mass surveillance of Americans"" would not stand up to public political or legal scrutiny if the extent of it became known. ""This is a turning point and it marks the beginning of a new effort to reclaim our rights from the NSA and restore the public's seat at the table of government"" he said.

The White House said Obama will now ask the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court which gives legal oversight to the system to approve the current bulk collection program for a final 90-day period as the president attempts to implement his plan.



Attention will now be focused on how that can be achieved in Congress. In Washington on Tuesday leaders of the House intelligence committee outlined their proposals for NSA reform which they say would also end bulk phone record collection but which have been greeted with scepticism by civil liberties campaigners.

The bill being pushed by the committee’s Republican chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan and its ranking Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland – both NSA allies – would empower the government to compel phone companies and internet service providers to turn over records with a “reasonable articulable suspicion” of connection to terrorism or espionage along with data of individuals up to two “hops” – or degrees of separation – away.

Although a single order could involve sprawling into the data of thousands of individuals Rogers and Ruppersberger said their bill would represent “ending bulk collection”. Both men have been vocal defenders of the phone records program but they now concede that it made their colleagues and constituents uncomfortable. ""We're beyond that"" Rogers said. ""Now our goal and our number one goal always has been not about about bulk collection but: how do we catch these people trying to call in to the United States? Can we do it in a way that prevents another 9/11?""

Ruppersberger whose district includes the NSA's Fort Meade headquarters added: ""Mike and I knew we had to deal with the perception and get the confidence of the American people.""



Both leaders said they were close to alignment with the White House proposal which they said currently provides greater up-front judicial scrutiny on the data collection than their own effort. ""We think the White House is now moving toward our position on this. We've been sharing text with them for the past few weeks"" Rogers said.



Neither the White House nor the House intelligence committee proposal would require telecommunications firms to keep such records any longer than the current 18-month maximum a significant shift away from the five years during which they are currently held by NSA. The moves represent a significant overhaul of the secret mass collection practices of the past 13 years as exposed by Snowden.



Under the House intelligence committee bill judges on the secret Fisa court would approve the NSA's procedures for acquiring the data from the firms but would only review the specific data collection after the collection occurs. According to a draft of the bill judges who considered the data collection improper could order a purge of it.

The introduction of the bill sets up a legislative battle with a more far-reaching reform effort authored by GOP congressman Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Democratic senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. The Leahy-Sensenbrenner bill known as the USA Freedom Act permits the government to acquire data related to an ""ongoing"" terrorism investigation – the standard set out in the Patriot Act which since 2006 the NSA has contended its bulk collection of Americans' phone data meets.

Rogers and Ruppersberger forcefully rejected that proposal. ""We believe the other bills out there don't meet that standard of still being able to protect Americans through intelligence-gathering"" Rogers said.



On Monday night Sensenbrenner was just as critical of the Rogers-Ruppersberger bill describing it as “convoluted” and insufficiently protective of Americans' privacy. “It limits but does not end bulk collection. Provisions included in the draft fall well short of the safeguards in the USA Freedom Act and do not strike the proper balance between privacy and security” he said.

Dianne Feinstein the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee said on Tuesday that she would hold a hearing on the White House and House intelligence committee proposals a further indication that the Leahy-Sensenbrenner initiative faces an uphill struggle to avoid being squeezed out.



“I believe the president’s plan is a worthy effort. I have said before that I am open to reforming the call records program as long as any changes meet our national security needs and address privacy concerns and that any changes continue to provide the government with the means to protect against future terrorist attacks” Feinstein said.



In a statement Leahy who chairs the Senate judiciary committee also welcomed Obama's plan to end collection of US phone records. ""That is a key element of what I and others have outlined in the USA Freedom Act and that is what the American people have been demanding"" he said.

“I look forward to having meaningful consultation with the administration on these matters and reviewing its proposal to evaluate whether it sufficiently protects Americans’ privacy. In the meantime the president could end bulk collection once and for all on Friday by not seeking reauthorisation of this program. Rather than postponing action any longer I hope he chooses this path.”

A spokeswoman for one of the major telephone companies Sprint said: ""We are reviewing the Obama administration’s proposal with great interest and look forward to seeing additional details of the administration’s proposal.""

Senator Mark Udall the Colorado Democrat who has been a prominent critic of bulk surveillance said he was encouraged by the president's plans. ""The constitution is clear … the ongoing bulk collections of Americans' call records is an unacceptable invasion of our privacy that doesn't make us safer and must be brought to an end"" he said.



Another Democratic critic Ron Wyden of Oregon said Obama's shift against bulk collection was a victory. ""This is the start of the end of dragnet surveillance in America"" said Wyden who added that he spoke to the White House on Monday night.

""It's very clear now that the administration agrees with us"" said Wyden hailing a switch from both the Bush and Obama administration stance that ""collecting these records is vital to western civilisation"".

Udall and Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky urged Obama to immediately cease the collection of any phone or email data without a court approved warrant and criticised the House intelligence bill as insufficient. ""There may be potential for abuse in the House proposal"" Udall said."
_GOVT_SURV,Sep_18_2013_Extended_Ruling_by_Secret_Court_Backs_Collection_of_Phone_Data.txt,"WASHINGTON — The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on Tuesday offered its most extensive public explanation for why it has allowed the government to keep records of all Americans’ phone calls releasing a previously classified opinion in which it said the program was constitutional and did not violate Americans’ privacy rights.

While the once-secret call log program has been periodically reapproved by the court since 2006 it has come under criticism from members of Congress of both parties and civil libertarians since its existence came to public light in June after leaks by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.

In a 29-page opinion that quoted the N.S.A. director Keith Alexander as saying the leaks had caused “significant and irreversible damage” to national security Judge Claire V. Eagan a federal judge in the Northern District of Oklahoma declared that the program was lawful. So she wrote any decision about whether to keep it was a political question not a legal one.

“This court is mindful that this matter comes before it at a time when unprecedented disclosures have been made about this and other highly sensitive programs designed to obtain foreign intelligence information and carry out counterterrorism investigations” she wrote adding: “In the wake of these disclosures whether and to what extent the government seeks to continue the program discussed in this memorandum opinion is a matter for the political branches to decide.”

The opinion by Judge Eagan — a 2001 appointee of President George W. Bush who was assigned to the surveillance court by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. this year — also noted that no telecommunications company had invoked its legal right to object to turning over its customers’ calling records to the government.

“To date no holder of records who has received an order to produce bulk telephony metadata has challenged the legality of such an order” she wrote.

The opinion dated Aug. 29 was the first written since the program came to light. While other judges had routinely reauthorized the program every 90 days with only brief reiteration of the court’s legal analysis according to an official familiar with the still-classified rulings Judge Eagan wrote the lengthier memorandum apparently for the purpose of public release.

Judge Eagan noted in her opinion that the court had previously reauthorized the program to continue for another three months on July 19 after having held an “extensive hearing to receive testimony and evidence on this matter.” In a footnote she said that only the government and not opponents of the program participated in the hearing as is routine for such proceedings.

James R. Clapper the director of national intelligence lauded the opinion as one that “affirms that the bulk telephony metadata collection is both lawful and constitutional.” In a statement he said its release was consistent with President Obama’s call “for more transparency on these valuable intelligence programs.”

But Jameel Jaffer a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union called the opinion “completely unpersuasive” criticizing it for failing to mention a landmark privacy case decided by the Supreme Court last year and portraying its statutory analysis as “equally weak.”

“On the whole the opinion only confirms the folly of entrusting privacy rights to a court that hears argument only from the government” he said.

The legal analysis Judge Eagan endorsed echoes the basic arguments that the Obama administration has made in defending the program since it came to light including in an unsigned Justice Department “white paper“ it released last month.

Among those arguments was that phone call metadata — phone numbers time and duration of calls but not content — is not protected by Fourth Amendment privacy rights because it does not involve eavesdropping on the content of calls.

She also agreed that the government has legal authority to collect all calling records from phone companies under a provision of the Patriot Act that allows it to obtain business records deemed “relevant” to an investigation; and that members of Congress had had an opportunity to learn how the Patriot Act was secretly being interpreted before lawmakers reauthorized the law.

The program traces its origins to one aspect of the Bush administration’s expansion of surveillance outside statutory or judicial frameworks after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 2001. It was later brought under the authority of the surveillance court and linked to the Patriot Act.

The security agency uses the database to perform “link analysis” seeing who may have been in contact — directly or indirectly — with terrorism suspects in hopes of identifying hidden cells. Under rules imposed by the court the agency may search for phone calls only if there is “reasonable articulable suspicion” that the underlying phone number is linked to terrorism.

In explaining why the court had reauthorized the program Judge Eagan said that “according to the government” there were no “compliance incidents” — violations of the rules limiting how the database may be accessed by analysts — in the previous three-month period.

Last week the government released documents by another judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to a 2009 reprimand of the security agency for violating the rules and for misleading the court about how it was using the database. It had come to light that the agency was automatically comparing each day’s fresh batch of phone data with an “alert list” of thousands of numbers its analysts had flagged only about 10 percent of which met the standard of the court-imposed rules.

“The court is aware that in prior years there have been incidents of noncompliance with respect to N.S.A.’s handling of produced information” Judge Eagan wrote. “Through oversight by this court over a period of months those issues were resolved.”"
_GOVT_SURV,Dec_24_2005_Spy_Agency_Mined_Vast_Data_Trove_Officials_Report.txt,"The current and former government officials who discussed the program were granted anonymity because it remains classified.

Bush administration officials declined to comment on Friday on the technical aspects of the operation and the N.S.A.'s use of broad searches to look for clues on terrorists. Because the program is highly classified many details of how the N.S.A. is conducting it remain unknown and members of Congress who have pressed for a full Congressional inquiry say they are eager to learn more about the program's operational details as well as its legality.

Officials in the government and the telecommunications industry who have knowledge of parts of the program say the N.S.A. has sought to analyze communications patterns to glean clues from details like who is calling whom how long a phone call lasts and what time of day it is made and the origins and destinations of phone calls and e-mail messages. Calls to and from Afghanistan for instance are known to have been of particular interest to the N.S.A. since the Sept. 11 attacks the officials said.

This so-called ""pattern analysis"" on calls within the United States would in many circumstances require a court warrant if the government wanted to trace who calls whom.

The use of similar data-mining operations by the Bush administration in other contexts has raised strong objections most notably in connection with the Total Information Awareness system developed by the Pentagon for tracking terror suspects and the Department of Homeland Security's Capps program for screening airline passengers. Both programs were ultimately scrapped after public outcries over possible threats to privacy and civil liberties.

But the Bush administration regards the N.S.A.'s ability to trace and analyze large volumes of data as critical to its expanded mission to detect terrorist plots before they can be carried out officials familiar with the program say. Administration officials maintain that the system set up by Congress in 1978 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not give them the speed and flexibility to respond fully to terrorist threats at home.

A former technology manager at a major telecommunications company said that since the Sept. 11 attacks the leading companies in the industry have been storing information on calling patterns and giving it to the federal government to aid in tracking possible terrorists.

""All that data is mined with the cooperation of the government and shared with them and since 9/11 there's been much more active involvement in that area"" said the former manager a telecommunications expert who did not want his name or that of his former company used because of concern about revealing trade secrets.

Such information often proves just as valuable to the government as eavesdropping on the calls themselves the former manager said.

""If they get content that's useful to them too but the real plum is going to be the transaction data and the traffic analysis"" he said. ""Massive amounts of traffic analysis information -- who is calling whom who is in Osama Bin Laden's circle of family and friends -- is used to identify lines of communication that are then given closer scrutiny.""

Several officials said that after President Bush's order authorizing the N.S.A. program senior government officials arranged with officials of some of the nation's largest telecommunications companies to gain access to switches that act as gateways at the borders between the United States' communications networks and international networks. The identities of the corporations involved could not be determined.

The switches are some of the main arteries for moving voice and some Internet traffic into and out of the United States and with the globalization of the telecommunications industry in recent years many international-to-international calls are also routed through such American switches.

One outside expert on communications privacy who previously worked at the N.S.A. said that to exploit its technological capabilities the American government had in the last few years been quietly encouraging the telecommunications industry to increase the amount of international traffic that is routed through American-based switches.

The growth of that transit traffic had become a major issue for the intelligence community officials say because it had not been fully addressed by 1970's-era laws and regulations governing the N.S.A. Now that foreign calls were being routed through switches on American soil some judges and law enforcement officials regarded eavesdropping on those calls as a possible violation of those decades-old restrictions including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which requires court-approved warrants for domestic surveillance.

Historically the American intelligence community has had close relationships with many communications and computer firms and related technical industries. But the N.S.A.'s backdoor access to major telecommunications switches on American soil with the cooperation of major corporations represents a significant expansion of the agency's operational capability according to current and former government officials.

Phil Karn a computer engineer and technology expert at a major West Coast telecommunications company said access to such switches would be significant. ""If the government is gaining access to the switches like this what you're really talking about is the capability of an enormous vacuum operation to sweep up data"" he said."
_GOVT_SURV,Jul_23_2013_A_Better_Secret_Court.txt,"TOLEDO Ohio — CONGRESS created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 1978 as a check on executive authority. Recent disclosures about vast data-gathering by the government have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the court’s actions. Congress can take a simple step to restore confidence in the court’s impartiality and integrity: authorizing its judges to appoint lawyers to serve the public interest when novel legal issues come before it.

The court is designed to protect individual liberties as the government protects us from foreign dangers. In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled that the Nixon administration had violated the Fourth Amendment by conducting warrantless surveillance on a radical domestic group the White Panthers who were suspected of bombing a C.I.A. recruiting office in Ann Arbor Mich. In 1975 and 1976 the Church Committee a Senate panel produced a series of reports about foreign and domestic intelligence operations including surveillance by the F.B.I. of suspected communists radicals and other activists — including notoriously the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

The Foreign Intelligence Service Act set up the FISA Court in response. To obtain authority to intercept the phone and electronic communications of American citizens and permanent residents the government must only show probable cause that the target has a connection to a foreign government or entity or a foreign terrorist group. It does not have to show as with an ordinary search warrant probable cause that the target is suspected of a crime.

For decades the court worked under the radar. That changed after 2005 when The New York Times disclosed a National Security Agency program of surveillance of e-mail to and from foreign countries. Though the surveillance was conducted outside of FISA (Congress later specified that FISA court approval was required) the disclosures brought the court to the public’s attention. Criticism of the court (on which I served for six years after 9/11 while the caseload grew enormously) revived recently after revelations that the N.S.A. without court orders specifying individual targets gathered troves of data from companies like Google and Facebook.

Critics note that the court has approved almost all of the government’s surveillance requests. Some say the court is virtually creating a secret new body of law governing privacy secrecy and surveillance. Others have called for declassified summaries of all of the court’s secret rulings.

James Robertson a retired federal judge who served with me on the FISA court recently called for greater transparency of the court’s proceedings. He has proposed the naming of an advocate with high-level security clearance to argue against the government’s filings. He suggested that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board which oversees surveillance activities could also provide a check. I would go even further.

In an ordinary criminal case the adversarial process assures legal representation of the defendant. Clearly in top-secret cases involving potential surveillance targets a lawyer cannot in the conventional sense represent the target.

Congress could however authorize the FISA judges to appoint from time to time independent lawyers with security clearances to serve “pro bono publico” — for the public’s good — to challenge the government when an application for a FISA order raises new legal issues.

During my six years on the court there were several occasions when I and other judges faced issues none of us had encountered before. A staff of experienced lawyers assists the court but their help was not always enough given the complexity of the issues.

The low FISA standard of probable cause — not spinelessness or excessive deference to the government — explains why the court has so often granted the Justice Department’s requests. But rapid advances in technology have outpaced the amendments to FISA even the most recent ones in 2008.

Having lawyers challenge novel legal assertions in these secret proceedings would result in better judicial outcomes. Even if the government got its way all or most of the time the court would have more fully developed its reasons for letting it do so. Of equal importance the appointed lawyer could appeal a decision in the government’s favor to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review — and then to the Supreme Court. No opportunity for such review exists today because only the government can appeal a FISA court ruling.

One obvious objection: judges considering whether to issue an ordinary search warrant hear only from the government. Why should this not be the same when the government goes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court?

My answer: the court is unique among judicial institutions in balancing the right to privacy against the president’s duty to protect the public and it encounters issues of statutory and constitutional interpretation that no other court does or can.

For an ordinary search warrant the judge has a large and well-developed body of precedent. When a warrant has been issued and executed the subject knows immediately. If indicted he can challenge the warrant. He can also move to have property returned or sue for damages. These protections are not afforded to FISA surveillance targets. Even where a target is indicted laws like the Classified Information Procedures Act almost always preclude the target from learning about the order or challenging the evidence. This situation puts basic constitutional protections at risk and creates doubts about the legitimacy of the court’s work and the independence and integrity of its judges. To avert these dangers Congress should amend FISA to give the court’s judges the discretion to appoint lawyers to serve not just the interests of the target and the public — but those of the court as well."
_GOVT_SURV,May_21_2003_Experts_Say_Technology_Is_Widely_Disseminated_Inside_and_Outside_Military.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO May 20— Congressional efforts to rein in a Pentagon surveillance project may be ineffective because new surveillance technology is being widely disseminated both inside and outside of the military and other less visible federal offices are pursuing similar research industry executives and computer scientists say.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Information Awareness Office overseen by Adm. John M. Poindexter faced widespread opposition last year to its Total Information Awareness project after reports about the project raised concerns about civil liberties. On Tuesday the agency delivered a 102-page report to Congress to reassure legislators.

But a related program being pursued by the government's intelligence agencies has drawn no public scrutiny.

The research being conducted for the National Security Agency Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency is being financed by a little known federal office called the Advanced Research and Development Activity established during the Clinton administration to provide federal intelligence agencies with basic research capability similar to that of Darpa.

The agency has a budget of about $100 million a year according to a former government official. Its research covers a wide range of areas from nanotechnology to quantum computing.

The agency is pursuing research in areas like facial recognition as well as basic image recognition technologies according to computer scientists. In March 2000 for example the organization reviewed 45 research proposals and made grants to nine organizations including corporations universities and research centers that are studying various image recognition problems.

ARDA is also financing a program called ''Novel Intelligence from Massive Data'' which was begun after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The intent of the project is to give intelligence analysts early warning of ''strategic surprises'' in the same way that the Total Information Awareness system was intended to provide advance information about possible domestic terrorist attacks.

Both the Pentagon's Total Information Awareness project and the ARDA research project seek to detect hidden patterns of activity in vast collections of digital data. The development of these technologies has drawn opposition from civil liberties groups and some technical organizations.

Moreover several computer scientists question whether such giant data ''hoovering'' operations involving either vast databases or software to scan connected databases through a network can be successful.

They emphasize that once enemies of the United States are aware that digital sentries are hunting for unusual patterns of information they will simply alter their behavior.

''You won't find terrorists buying C4 explosives with a Mastercard'' one computer scientist said.

A spokeswoman for the security agency said in a faxed statement that the Novel Intelligence research had begun in 2001 and that the only data that would be used was open source and that data about analysts would be collected with their consent within strict guidelines. Computer scientists have raised questions about the project's research agenda because the technologies can easily be disseminated broadly.

''If they were to stick to strictly military-related research and development there is less of an issue but these technologies have much broader social implications'' said Barbara Simons a computer scientist who is past president of the Association of Computing Machinery an organization that has expressed concerns about the Pentagon's project.

Information about the project on the organization's Web site (http://ic-arda.org) states that the agency is developing technologies to avoid events like the Sept. 11 attacks and other actions taken by enemies of the United States.

Since the Watergate era the nation's intelligence agencies have been generally restricted from conducting domestic surveillance. But concerns about terrorism have led the Bush administration to try to break down barriers between various government agencies.

Military analysts said that one of the problems facing Congress was that attempts to limit weapons technologies have frequently left basic research exempt from restrictions in areas like antiballistic missile defense and nuclear weapons design.

''The downside is that basic research creates new pressures'' said Christopher Paine a senior analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council an environmental organization that has an arms control segment. ''When the political climate changes these opportunities loom large.''"
_GOVT_SURV,Jul_14_2014_Government_defends_mass_interception_of_online_data_at_tribunal.txt,"Mass interception of online communications by intelligence agencies is necessary – even if only one person is being targeted lawyers for the government have told a tribunal hearing complaints about surveillance.

The government's arguments were disclosed as lawyers for Liberty and otherright organisations told the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) safeguards surrounding GCHQ's collection online data are inadequate and do not conform to the law.

The groundbreaking case against GCHQ and the government is the result of revelations by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. It has been brought by Privacy International Liberty Amnesty International the American Civil Liberties Union and other overseas human rights groups.

In an 85-page written argument released at the IPT government lawyers cite the example of the intelligence agencies needing to obtain communications being sent to a suspect in Syria.

""For nearly all forms of internet-based communication the only way to intercept those [messages] being sent [to the suspect] is to intercept a substantially greater volume of communications (including potentially a volume of internal communications) and then apply a selection stage to identify the communications in question.

""... Unless the [civil liberties groups] wish to submit that the intelligence services should not be able to obtain the external communications that are needed for the purposes of national security etc they must accept some form of interception regime that permits substantially more communications to be intercepted (including potentially internal communications) than are actually being sought.""

But Matthew Ryder QC for Liberty and other human rights groups told the tribunal: ""Our challenge is against the legal framework which we say is inadequate and not in accordance with the law.

""Tempora is a UK alleged government programme [which] involves the collection of vast amounts of information flowing through fibre-optic cables ... It may be that [the government has] crossed a Rubicon and decided that [mass] data-gathering exercises are something [it] should try out – but you can't have it under the existing regime.""

Ryder said the regulations under which interceptions are carried out did not tell the public that carrying out an online search on Google – often using a foreign server overseas and therefore deeemed to be an ""external communication"" – could make them the subject of official surveillance without an individual warrant being obtained.

Liberty's submission to the tribunal warns that ""the US government's collection of personal communications and related data from US communication service providers is carried out on a vast scale"" and any information obtained by the US ""is likely to be shared extensively between US and UK agencies"".

A written submission to the tribunal from Privacy International asks whether it is right ""that the government can issue a general warrant for the universal search seizure and sophisticated automatic analysis of communications and their sharing with foreign governments.

""[The case] is also about the government's ability to obtain virtually all communications of UK residents from the intelligence services of other states without requiring any warrant at all and subject only to a general power to act 'in the interests of national security'.""

The legal challenge is the first of dozens of GCHQ-related claims to be examined in detail by the IPT which hears complaints against British intelligence agencies and government bodies that carry out surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).

The civil liberties organisations are concerned that their private communications have been monitored under Tempora whose existence was revealed by Snowden. They also complain that information obtained through the NSA's Prism and upstream programmes may have been shared with the British intelligence services sidestepping protections provided by the UK legal system.

The chairman of the tribunal Mr Justice Burton asked lawyers for the government whether intelligence-sharing with the United States – where information was intercepted overseas by foreign agencies – complied with the right to privacy and family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights.

James Eadie QC for the government said he believed the process was compliant with the convention but sought time for further clarification.

Burton said the IPT was unusual in hearing evidence on the basis of assumed facts. ""The whole shooting match is being assumed for the purpose of today"" he added.

Written submissions for the government accept that under the ""alleged"" Tempora operation ""the claimants' [the civil liberty organisations'] communications might in principle have been intercepted in the UK … and at least some of those intercepted communications might in principle have been read looked at or listened [to].""

There are four other members of the tribunal along with Burton: Robert Seabrook QC Christopher Gardner QC chief justice of the British Indian Ocean Territory Geoffrey Rivlin QC and Mrs Justice Carr a high court judge. The hearing is expected to last all week."
_GOVT_SURV,Dec_20_2002_Bush_Administration_to_Propose_System_for_Wide_Monitoring_of_Internet.txt,"The Bush administration is planning to propose requiring Internet service providers to help build a centralized system to enable broad monitoring of the Internet and potentially surveillance of its users.

The proposal is part of a final version of a report ''The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace'' set for release early next year according to several people who have been briefed on the report. It is a component of the effort to increase national security after the Sept. 11 attacks.

The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board is preparing the report and it is intended to create public and private cooperation to regulate and defend the national computer networks not only from everyday hazards like viruses but also from terrorist attack. Ultimately the report is intended to provide an Internet strategy for the new Department of Homeland Security.

Such a proposal which would be subject to Congressional and regulatory approval would be a technical challenge because the Internet has thousands of independent service providers from garage operations to giant corporations like American Online AT&T Microsoft and Worldcom.

The report does not detail specific operational requirements locations for the centralized system or costs people who were briefed on the document said.

While the proposal is meant to gauge the overall state of the worldwide network some officials of Internet companies who have been briefed on the proposal say they worry that such a system could be used to cross the indistinct border between broad monitoring and wiretap.

Stewart Baker a Washington lawyer who represents some of the nation's largest Internet providers said ''Internet service providers are concerned about the privacy implications of this as well as liability'' since providing access to live feeds of network activity could be interpreted as a wiretap or as the ''pen register'' and ''trap and trace'' systems used on phones without a judicial order.

Mr. Baker said the issue would need to be resolved before the proposal could move forward.

Tiffany Olson the deputy chief of staff for the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board said yesterday that the proposal which includes a national network operations center was still in flux. She said the proposed methods did not necessarily require gathering data that would allow monitoring at an individual user level.

But the need for a large-scale operations center is real Ms. Olson said because Internet service providers and security companies and other online companies only have a view of the part of the Internet that is under their control.

''We don't have anybody that is able to look at the entire picture'' she said. ''When something is happening we don't know it's happening until it's too late.''

The government report was first released in draft form in September and described the monitoring center but it suggested it would likely be controlled by industry. The current draft sets the stage for the government to have a leadership role.

The new proposal is labeled in the report as an ''early-warning center'' that the board says is required to offer early detection of Internet-based attacks as well as defense against viruses and worms.

But Internet service providers argue that its data-monitoring functions could be used to track the activities of individuals using the network.

An official with a major data services company who has been briefed on several aspects of the government's plans said it was hard to see how such capabilities could be provided to government without the potential for real-time monitoring even of individuals.

''Part of monitoring the Internet and doing real-time analysis is to be able to track incidents while they are occurring'' the official said.

The official compared the system to Carnivore the Internet wiretap system used by the F.B.I. saying: ''Am I analogizing this to Carnivore? Absolutely. But in fact it's 10 times worse. Carnivore was working on much smaller feeds and could not scale. This is looking at the whole Internet.''

One former federal Internet security official cautioned against drawing conclusions from the information that is available so far about the Securing Cyberspace report's conclusions.

Michael Vatis the founding director of the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Center and now the director of the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth said it was common for proposals to be cast in the worst possible light before anything is actually known about the technology that will be used or the legal framework within which it will function.

''You get a firestorm created before anybody knows what concretely is being proposed'' Mr. Vatis said.

A technology that is deployed without the proper legal controls ''could be used to violate privacy'' he said and should be considered carefully.

But at the other end of the spectrum of reaction Mr. Vatis warned ''You end up without technology that could be very useful to combat terrorism information warfare or some other harmful act.''"
_GOVT_SURV,Jun_28_2016_Edward_Snowden_Criticizes_‘Big_Brother’_Measure_in_Russia.txt,"MOSCOW — Edward J. Snowden an American who took refuge in Russia after leaking a trove of classified United States data from global surveillance has criticized a proposed Russian law as an assault on freedom of speech and has been rebuffed in an effort to collect a free-speech prize in Norway.

Mr. Snowden who was charged by the United States in 2013 with violating the Espionage Act was invited to Norway by a writers’ advocacy group to receive the prize and sought guarantees in court that he would not be handed over to the American authorities. News agencies reported on Monday that a court in Oslo rejected his bid.

His criticism of the Russian law came over the weekend when he said on Twitter that it was “an unworkable unjustifiable violation of rights that should never be signed.” The law was passed by the lower house of Parliament on Friday; the speaker of the upper house Valentina I. Matviyenko signaled on Monday that her chamber would pass it as well.

Today’s Headlines: European Morning Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.

“Mass surveillance doesn’t work” Mr. Snowden wrote. “This bill will take money and liberty without improving safety.”

Rights activists have protested several elements of the bill especially a provision making it a crime to fail to report the planning of a terrorist act and another that would make it a crime to write social media posts that justify terrorism. Under the law Russian cellular and internet providers would have to store all communications data for six months and help security services decipher encrypted messages. Mr. Snowden called it “Russia’s new Big Brother law.”

Speaking to the Interfax news agency on Monday Mr. Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly G. Kucherena defended the criticism and said it showed that Mr. Snowden was “a man of principles” who “criticizes Russia too.”

“We live in a free society in a democratic state” Mr. Kuchenera said.

During his three years in Russia Mr. Snowden whose asylum was approved personally by President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to stay active as an advocate for civil liberties while remaining on good terms with his Russian hosts. He takes part in conferences and public events abroad through internet teleconferencing to avoid traveling where he might be detained.

Mr. Snowden has said that he does not plan to die in Russia and that he would like to return to the United States. His American lawyer Ben Wizner said that Mr. Snowden would seek a pardon from President Obama."
_GOVT_SURV,Feb__3_2015_Proposed_changes_to_US_data_collection_fall_short_of_NSA_reformers'_goals.txt,"The US intelligence community has delivered a limited list of tweaks to how long it can hold information on ordinary citizens and hide secret trawls for data responding to Barack Obama’s call for reform of its surveillance practices in the wake of revelations about NSA practices.



Published by the office of the director of national intelligence James Clapper just six days before a recently announced visit to Washington by the German chancellor Angela Merkel the report is the culmination of a year-long effort to respond to revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

But the report does not appear to address the role of telecommunications companies in collecting metadata and the use of encryption to prevent hacking and privacy critics were quick to pounce on a year of promises with little reform to show.

“It’s hard to see much ‘there’ there” Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. “When it comes to reforming intelligence programs and protecting Americans’ privacy there is much much more work to be done.”

The outline from the intelligence community also appears to fall short of the legislative changes attempted by campaigners in Congress focusing instead on measures to tighten internal guidelines and provide foreigners with some of the protections allowed for US citizens.

These measures include:

Limiting how long personal data gathered from non-US citizens can be held to five years so long as it is deemed not relevant to ongoing intelligence investigations.

Asking Congress to provide some foreign nationals access to legal redress if their private information has been wilfully disclosed by US intelligence agencies.

Limiting to three years how long the FBI can prevent disclosure of its surveillance activities using so-called national security letters unless a special agent deems otherwise.

The White House insisted the report “highlights substantial progress and reflects an ongoing commitment to greater transparency”.

“As we continue to face threats from terrorism proliferation and cyber-attacks we must use our intelligence capabilities in a way that optimally protects our national security and supports our foreign policy while keeping the public trust and respecting privacy and civil liberties” said Obama’s homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco in a separate statement.

Other measures outlined in the new report include steps to clarify the protection given to whistleblowers if they follow internal rules and a requirement that “any significant compliance incident involving personal information regardless of the person’s nationality” be reported to Clapper.

In his landmark speech on privacy last January Obama said the government should no longer hold databases of every call record made in the United States citing the “potential for abuse”.

But efforts to enact his proposal have hit a number of roadblocks including fears that it would be impractical to ask telephone providers to keep the records instead as initially suggested by the White House.

Last year telecom giants questioned reform-minded suggestions that they should take over from the NSA. The idea that companies such as AT&T should host their clients’ metadata – information about call duration recipients and locations – still suggested the data could then be accessed by the US authorities. Telecoms have insisted they would be sceptical about such a scheme unless they were legally compelled to do it.

The official results of Obama’s call for surveillance reform also appear to have failed to address encryption. The FBI director James Comey and other officials have been highly critical of the use of encryption by tech companies such as Apple to protect their users’ information. Comey has argued that stronger encryption baked in to some technology after the Snowden revelations will aid criminals and terrorists and shut out law enforcement.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) principal technologist Chris Soghoian said privacy experts were still waiting to see what Obama would say about encryption. “The hope is that the president sees cybersecurity as important – and that the legislature will stand behind encryption that will protect all Americans at risk” he told the Guardian.

While praising the report’s suggestion for Congress to push through a new version of the USA Freedom Act Kevin Bankston policy director of New America’s Open Technology Institute called Tuesday’s reforms “disappointingly mild merely nibbling around the edges of the NSA’s vast surveillance authorities”.

Tim Karr senior director of strategy at Free Press said: “In general we have been pleased with the positions that the president has taken on a number of policy issues concerning the internet including net neutrality and widening access to municipal broadband. However when it comes to surveillance he seems to be dragging his feet.”

The intelligence report itself acknowledges that further reforms called for by the president such as ending the collection of bulk data by the government have not been implemented possibly due to stalled legislative efforts in Congress.

“The administration was disappointed that the 113th Congress ended without enacting this legislation” it says. “The Intelligence Community encourages Congress to quickly take up and pass legislation that would allow the government to end bulk collection of telephony metadata records under Section 215 while ensuring that the government has access to the information it needs to meet its national security requirements.”

Some of the other Obama recommendations were addressed by intelligence chiefs in an interim report last October but this did little to satisfy concerns among key allies such as Merkel whom Obama will host at the White House on Monday."
_GOVT_SURV,Sep_25_2015_Court_hears_first_arguments_in_case_challenging_bulk_data_collection_by_NSA.txt,"A federal court in Virginia on Friday heard the first oral arguments in a case challenging the “upstream” bulk collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).



Related: NSA's Prism surveillance program: how it works and what it can do

The plaintiffs claim that the NSA’s “upstream” program which was partially revealed in the documents leaked by Edward Snowden in June 2013 is illegally surveilling the communications of all internet users.

The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of the Wikimedia foundation – which owns and operates Wikipedia – as well as Human Rights Watch the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and several other plaintiffs including the Nation magazine.

Attorneys representing the NSA filed a motion to dismiss the case claiming the plaintiffs’ case was “speculative” and had no standing.

Lawyers for the ACLU told the court that given what was now known about the “upstream” program – which they said tapped into the “backbone of the internet” by taking information from fibre cables and infrastructure – the NSA “must be intercepting some of Wikimedia’s communications”.

The case was first filed in Maryland. It had to be moved after it emerged that Snowden’s mother worked in the Maryland district court as a senior administrator.

“In the course of its surveillance the NSA copies and combs through vast amounts of internet traffic which it intercepts inside the United States with the help of major telecommunications companies” the ACLU said in a statement.



“It searches that traffic for keywords called ‘selectors’ that are associated with its many targets. Public disclosures and reports show that the government is copying and reviewing virtually all text-based communications entering and leaving the country.”

The ACLU’s lawyers claimed that meant it was “virtually certain” their clients’ data had been surveilled. The government said that this was “just speculation”.

Rodney Patton representing the NSA said the complaint had not proved that the plaintiffs’ communications had definitely been under surveillance.

“They will tell you a lot of things today and the words will be ‘They must be doing this’” Patton said. “These are speculative words.”

Patton said that the scope of the upstream program was classified as were its targets.

“The point is” he said “how the programme operates is classified.”

Patrick Toomey an ACLU staff attorney argued on behalf of the plaintiffs. He said that in order to carry out the kind of surveillance revealed in the Snowden documents and subsequently confirmed in a report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board the NSA would have to “[open and] reassemble all packets of data going in and out [of the country]”.

Toomey told the court this represented “a grave constitutional violation”.

Judge TS Ellis III asked Patton that if the details of the programme were all classified “how in the world do plaintiffs show standing?”

“I’m just making the observation that this is a very difficult burden on the plaintiff” Ellis said. He said the government was effectively arguing that “just because you all keep things secret the constitutionality can’t be questioned”.

The key for the plaintiffs was to convince the judge that their case is sufficiently different from that in Clapper v Amnesty International a case in which the Fisa Amendments Act was challenged. It was thrown out of court for being too speculative in February 2013 – less than four months before the first of Snowden’s leaks detailing the scale of the NSA’s bulk data collection were published.

Afterwards Toomey spoke to reporters outside the courtroom.

“This is the surveillance of the future” he said. “Real-time communications being monitored.”

He said that “obviously” he disagreed with the government’s view that his case was speculative.

“Americans should not have to worry about the government looking over their shoulder whenever they browse the internet” he said.

The judge is expected to rule on the motion in the next few weeks."
_GOVT_SURV,Nov__9_2015_Appeals_judges_grant_US_request_to_allow_NSA_data_collection_to_continue.txt,"An appeals court granted the US government’s emergency request to allow the National Security Agency to keep collecting telephone metadata on Tuesday after a judge ruled that the program “likely violates the constitution”.

In a case brought by activist Larry Klayman Washington DC district court judge Richard Leon ruled that the NSA must cease collecting the defendants’ information. Leon said he believed it was “substantially likely” that “the program is unlawful” and that in that event “the plaintiffs have suffered concrete harm traceable to the challenged program”.



The government filed a request for an emergency stay of the order saying it believed it was likely to win on appeal. A different panel of judges in a similar case ruled in favor of the NSA in October. After Leon rejected the government’s demand for a stay US authorities appealed the rejection and received the stay from a panel of three others David S Tatel Patricia A Millett and Thomas B Griffith.

The government said if a stay was not issued the order ran the risk of shutting down the whole bulk collection program. “Immediate compliance with the district court’s injunction would effectively require the abrupt termination of that important counter-intelligence program” counsel for the government said.

As a result of the ruling the NSA must also quarantine the data it already has related to JJ Little or his law firm JJ Little and Associates. The firm are co-plaintiffs with Klayman a conservative activist attorney and founder of Freedom Watch and Charles and Mary Ann Strange.



The bulk metadata collection program first made public by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is due to end on 29 November. But the judge said that a largely symbolic ruling was important given the high stakes. Klayman v Obama would not he said “be the last chapter in the ongoing struggle to balance privacy rights and national security interests under our constitution in an age of evolving technological wizardry”.



Elizabeth Goitein co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center said: “It may seem symbolic but it isn’t because there is tangible harm … There would be new data collected and stored for five years and that’s not nothing.”

The ruling said Gotein “says you can’t just sort-of comply with the law which is what the government had been saying it was going to do. There’s not wiggle room in the constitution.”

Snowden called the ruling “historic” in a message posted on Twitter.

“The government should now commit to destroying the call records that it collected illegally – not just its database of ‘raw’ data but any subsidiary databases that include query results” wrote Klayman in a statement.

The government hid behind a veil of secrecy in order to conduct the “likely unlawful” activity Leon found. “To them it is pure ‘conjecture’ that ‘records of Plaintiffs’ calls have been’ or ‘will be’ reviewed ‘during the remaining two months of the Section 215 program’” he wrote. “I wholeheartedly disagree.”



Leon said he regretted not issuing the injunction when he first ruled on the case and that his faith in the appeals system had been misplaced. “In my December 2013 Opinion I stayed my order pending appeal in light of the national security interests at stake and the novelty of the constitutional issues raised” he wrote. “I did so with the optimistic hope that the appeals process would move expeditiously.”

“However because it has been almost two years since I first found that the NSA’s Bulk Telephony Metadata Program likely violates the Constitution and because the loss of constitutional freedoms for even one day is a significant harm” he continued “I will not do so today.”"

A Federal District Court judge ruled on Monday that the National Security Agency program that is systematically keeping records of all Americans’ phone calls most likely violates the Constitution and he ordered the government to stop collecting data on two plaintiffs’ personal calls and destroy the records of their calling history Charlie Savage reports.

In a 68-page ruling Judge Richard J. Leon of the District of Columbia called the program’s technology “almost Orwellian” and suggested that James Madison the author of the Constitution would be “aghast” to learn that the government was encroaching on liberty in such a way.

“I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary’ invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval” Judge Leon wrote. “Surely such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.”

Judge Leon stayed his injunction “in light of the significant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues” allowing the government time to appeal it a matter that he said could take some six months. Read more »"
_GOVT_SURV,Mar_19_2014_US_tech_giants_knew_of_NSA_data_collection_agency's_top_lawyer_insists.txt,"The senior lawyer for the National Security Agency stated on Wednesday that US technology companies were fully aware of the surveillance agency’s widespread collection of data.



Rajesh De the NSA general counsel said all communications content and associated metadata harvested by the NSA under a 2008 surveillance law occurred with the knowledge of the companies – both for the internet collection program known as Prism and for the so-called “upstream” collection of communications moving across the internet.

Asked during a Wednesday hearing of the US government’s institutional privacy watchdog if collection under the law known as Section 702 or the Fisa Amendments Act occurred with the “full knowledge and assistance of any company from which information is obtained” De replied: “Yes.”

When the Guardian and the Washington Post broke the Prism story in June thanks to documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden nearly all the companies listed as participating in the program – Yahoo Apple Google Microsoft Facebook and AOL – claimed they did not know about a surveillance practice described as giving NSA vast access to their customers’ data. Some like Apple said they had “never heard” the term Prism.

De explained: “Prism was an internal government term that as the result of leaks became the public term” De said. “Collection under this program was a compulsory legal process that any recipient company would receive.”

After the hearing De added that service providers also know and receive legal compulsions surrounding NSA’s harvesting of communications data not from companies but directly in transit across the internet under 702 authority.

The disclosure of Prism resulted in a cataclysm in technology circles with tech giants launching extensive PR campaigns to reassure their customers of data security and successfully pressing the Obama administration to allow them greater leeway to disclose the volume and type of data requests served to them by the government.

Last week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he had called US president Barack Obama to voice concern about “the damage the government is creating for all our future.” There was no immediate response from the tech companies to De’s comments on Wednesday.

It is unclear what sort of legal process the government serves on a company to compel communications content and metadata access under Prism or through upstream collection. Documents leaked from Snowden indicate that the NSA possesses unmediated access to the company data.

The secret Fisa court overseeing US surveillance for the purposes of producing foreign intelligence issues annual authorisations blessing NSA’s targeting and associated procedures under Section 702.After winning a transparency battle with the administration in the Fisa court earlier this year the companies are now permitted to disclose the range of Fisa orders they receive in bands of 1000 which presumably include orders under 702.

Passed in 2008 Section 702 retroactively gave cover of law to a post-9/11 effort permitting the NSA to collect phone email internet and other communications content when one party to the communication is reasonably believed to be a non-American outside the United States. The NSA stores Prism data for five years and communications taken directly from the internet for two years.

While Section 702 forbids the intentional targeting of Americans or people inside the United States – a practice known as “reverse targeting” – significant amounts of Americans’ phone calls and emails are swept up in the process of collection.

In 2011 according to a now-declassified Fisa court ruling the NSA was found to have collected tens of thousands of emails between Americans which a judge on the court considered a violation of the US constitution and which the NSA says it is technologically incapable of fixing.

Renewed in December 2012 over the objections of senate intelligence committee members Ron Wyden and Mark Udall Section 702 also permits NSA analysts to search through the collected communications for identifying information about Americans an amendment to so-called “minimisation” rules revealed by the Guardian in August and termed the “backdoor search loophole” by Wyden.

De and his administration colleagues testifying before the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board strongly rejected suggestions by the panel that a court authorise searches for Americans’ information inside the 702 databases. “If you have to go back to court every time you look at the information in your custody you can imagine that would be quite burdensome” deputy assistant attorney general Brad Wiegmann told the board.

De argued that once the Fisa court permits the collection annually analysts ought to be free to comb through it and stated that there were sufficient privacy safeguards for Americans after collection and querying had occurred. “That information is at the government’s disposal to review in the first instance” De said.

De also stated that the NSA is not permitted to search for Americans’ data from communications taken directly off the internet citing greater risks to privacy.

Section 702 is not the only legal authority the US government possesses to harvest data transiting the internet.

Neither De nor any other US official discussed data taken from the internet under different legal authorities. Different documents Snowden disclosed published by the Washington Post indicated that NSA takes data as it transits between Yahoo and Google data centers an activity reportedly conducted not under Section 702 but under a seminal executive order known as 12333.

De and his administration colleagues were quick to answer the board that companies were aware of the government’s collection of data under 702 which Robert Litt general counsel for the director of national intelligence told the board was “one of the most valuable collection tools that we have.”

“All 702 collection is pursuant to court directives so they have to know” De reiterated to the Guardian.

• This article was amended on 20 March 2014 to remove statements in the original that the testimony by Rajesh De contradicted denials by technology companies about their knowledge of NSA data collection. It was also updated to clarify that the companies challenged the secrecy surrounding Section 702 orders. Other minor clarifications were also made."
_GOVT_SURV,Nov_28_2015_The_NSA's_bulk_metadata_collection_authority_just_expired._What_now?.txt,"The language in the US Justice Department statement is far from inspiring written in bland legalese but it still represents an important victory for the whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Related: NSA files decoded: Edward Snowden's surveillance revelations explained

The statement dated 28 November 2015 says: “Final temporary reauthorization of the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata data program in the US expires.”

What that means is that from Saturday the National Security Agency will no longer directly hold information about the phone calls of millions of US citizens.

The USA Freedom Act passed in the summer allowed the NSA a 180-day transition period to sort out arrangements. That period expired on Saturday.

It is modest change but it is at least a change raising public awareness of the scale of government surveillance and opening the way for privacy campaigners to chip away in hopes of further reforms.

What prompted the change?

The reform under the Freedom Act can be traced directly back to a document leaked by Snowden and reported in the Guardian in June 2013 by Glenn Greenwald.

The document was a top secret court order showing the NSA was collecting the phone records of citizens both in the US and overseas in bulk and indiscriminately. The order was granted by a secret government body the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court.

It contradicted a statement only months earlier by James Clapper director of national intelligence to a Senate committee claiming there was no such collection of the records of US citizens.

Did this amount to mass surveillance?

The intelligence agencies hate the description “mass surveillance” and insist what they are doing is bulk collection of data. They argue that although they gathered all this material they only looked at a small part of it and crucially did not look at content.

Privacy campaigners counter that just by having access to such huge volumes of data on every individual citizen amounts to mass surveillance and an invasion of privacy. They also argue that even if the agencies are not looking at content – listening to phone calls – they can build up a detailed profile of an individual just on the basis of who was called the location time and length of call.

What does the Freedom Act do?

Instead of being held directly by the NSA phone data will remain with the telecom companies. The NSA will have to go to the Fisa court to get access.

There is also a change to the Fisa court which will become a little less secret being forced to declassify some information about its rulings and to allow in some cases outside bodies to mount challenges.

How important is this reform?

It is a first step but a modest one. The problem – and it is a major one – is the reform applies only to phone records. The NSA can continue to harvest bulk communications from the internet and social media.

Snowden called the act historic but identified some of the changes as cosmetic. The American Civil Liberties Union described it as a “milestone” but cautioned about the wide range of surveillance powers the NSA and other agencies still enjoy.

Have terrorist attacks such as the one in Paris forced privacy campaigners into a rethink?

Related: Congress passes NSA surveillance reform in vindication for Snowden

Privacy campaigners have argued they are not opposed to targeted surveillance in which suspects are monitored. Their complaint is with bulk data collection and its indiscriminate nature.

The argument of the intelligence agencies is that if there is a terrorist attack or a kidnapping they have to be able to quickly access all the data in order to see if they can find any communications that might be related. If they have one name they want to see who that individual has been in contact with.

That seems at first glance a reasonable request. But a privacy and civil liberties review body set up by Barack Obama found no evidence that bulk data collection had made a difference in a single case.

“We have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation” it reported.

In terrorism case after terrorism case since 9/11 at least some of those involved were already known to intelligence agencies being treated as suspects or appearing on watch lists as individuals of concern. This was the case too in the Paris attacks in which some of the killers were already known to the French intelligence agencies.

What is happening elsewhere around the world?

Modest though the USA Freedom Act is it is an improvement on what is happening elsewhere. Governments in France and the UK have introduced – or are in the process of introducing – legislation that gives even more surveillance powers to intelligence agencies.



The UK has a proposed bill that enshrines all the surveillance powers it has been employing in the dark since at least 2001 and adds a few more. Unlike the US the bill permits bulk collection of phone records."
_GOVT_SURV,Jan__2_2014_Edward_Snowden_Whistle-Blower.txt,"Seven months ago the world began to learn the vast scope of the National Security Agency’s reach into the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the United States and around the globe as it collects information about their phone calls their email messages their friends and contacts how they spend their days and where they spend their nights. The public learned in great detail how the agency has exceeded its mandate and abused its authority prompting outrage at kitchen tables and at the desks of Congress which may finally begin to limit these practices.

The revelations have already prompted two federal judges to accuse the N.S.A. of violating the Constitution (although a third unfortunately found the dragnet surveillance to be legal). A panel appointed by President Obama issued a powerful indictment of the agency’s invasions of privacy and called for a major overhaul of its operations.

All of this is entirely because of information provided to journalists by Edward Snowden the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency’s voraciousness. Mr. Snowden is now living in Russia on the run from American charges of espionage and theft and he faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life looking over his shoulder.

Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed and the abuses he has exposed Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so but he has done his country a great service. It is time for the United States to offer Mr. Snowden a plea bargain or some form of clemency that would allow him to return home face at least substantially reduced punishment in light of his role as a whistle-blower and have the hope of a life advocating for greater privacy and far stronger oversight of the runaway intelligence community.

•

Mr. Snowden is currently charged in a criminal complaint with two violations of the Espionage Act involving unauthorized communication of classified information and a charge of theft of government property. Those three charges carry prison sentences of 10 years each and when the case is presented to a grand jury for indictment the government is virtually certain to add more charges probably adding up to a life sentence that Mr. Snowden is understandably trying to avoid.

The president said in August that Mr. Snowden should come home to face those charges in court and suggested that if Mr. Snowden had wanted to avoid criminal charges he could have simply told his superiors about the abuses acting in other words as a whistle-blower.

“If the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistle-blower protection to the intelligence community for the first time” Mr. Obama said at a news conference. “So there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.”

In fact that executive order did not apply to contractors only to intelligence employees rendering its protections useless to Mr. Snowden. More important Mr. Snowden told The Washington Post earlier this month that he did report his misgivings to two superiors at the agency showing them the volume of data collected by the N.S.A. and that they took no action. (The N.S.A. says there is no evidence of this.) That’s almost certainly because the agency and its leaders don’t consider these collection programs to be an abuse and would never have acted on Mr. Snowden’s concerns.

In retrospect Mr. Snowden was clearly justified in believing that the only way to blow the whistle on this kind of intelligence-gathering was to expose it to the public and let the resulting furor do the work his superiors would not. Beyond the mass collection of phone and Internet data consider just a few of the violations he revealed or the legal actions he provoked:

■ The N.S.A. broke federal privacy laws or exceeded its authority thousands of times per year according to the agency’s own internal auditor.

■ The agency broke into the communications links of major data centers around the world allowing it to spy on hundreds of millions of user accounts and infuriating the Internet companies that own the centers. Many of those companies are now scrambling to install systems that the N.S.A. cannot yet penetrate.

■ The N.S.A. systematically undermined the basic encryption systems of the Internet making it impossible to know if sensitive banking or medical data is truly private damaging businesses that depended on this trust.

■ His leaks revealed that James Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence lied to Congress when testifying in March that the N.S.A. was not collecting data on millions of Americans. (There has been no discussion of punishment for that lie.)

■ The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rebuked the N.S.A. for repeatedly providing misleading information about its surveillance practices according to a ruling made public because of the Snowden documents. One of the practices violated the Constitution according to the chief judge of the court.

■ A federal district judge ruled earlier this month that the phone-records-collection program probably violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. He called the program “almost Orwellian” and said there was no evidence that it stopped any imminent act of terror.

The shrill brigade of his critics say Mr. Snowden has done profound damage to intelligence operations of the United States but none has presented the slightest proof that his disclosures really hurt the nation’s security. Many of the mass-collection programs Mr. Snowden exposed would work just as well if they were reduced in scope and brought under strict outside oversight as the presidential panel recommended.

When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government. That’s why Rick Ledgett who leads the N.S.A.’s task force on the Snowden leaks recently told CBS News that he would consider amnesty if Mr. Snowden would stop any additional leaks. And it’s why President Obama should tell his aides to begin finding a way to end Mr. Snowden’s vilification and give him an incentive to return home."
_GOVT_SURV,Feb__8_2014_N.S.A._Program_Gathers_Data_on_a_Third_of_Nation’s_Calls_Officials_Say.txt,"WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency’s once-secret program that is collecting bulk records of Americans’ domestic phone calls is taking in a relatively small portion of the total volume of such calls each day officials familiar with the program said on Friday.

While the agency is collecting a large amount of landline phone data it has struggled to take in cellphone data which has undergone explosive growth in recent years and presents additional technological hurdles the officials said.

The revelation came days after the nation’s secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved President Obama’s proposal to impose new restrictions on when and how analysts with the N.S.A. may gain access to the raw database containing the bulk phone records according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

The bulk call records program began under the Bush administration and was based on claimed wartime powers. In 2006 the program was brought under the surveillance court’s authority. It came to light after leaks by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden.

On Friday The Washington Post reported that the N.S.A. is currently taking in data on less than 30 percent of phone calls. The article also said the agency had been collecting nearly all records about Americans’ phone calls in 2006 and that the N.S.A. was now trying to restore comprehensive coverage.

Officials partly confirmed The Post’s report although they said it was difficult to put a precise number on the percentage. But they disputed that the agency had ever had near-universal access to phone data saying cellphone records have always presented problems.

The Wall Street Journal reported in June that T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless were not part of the N.S.A.’s data collection and a report on surveillance policy last month by a review group appointed by Mr. Obama said that while the program “acquires a very large amount” of phone data each day that was still “only a small percentage of the total” calls.

One official said intelligence agencies have quietly chafed at assumptions that the N.S.A. was collecting all phone records. But they have been reluctant to correct the record because they did not want to draw attention to the gap and because it is in fact the agency’s goal to overcome technical hurdles that stop them from ingesting them all.

The greater attention to the gap puts new light on claims about the effectiveness of the program. Critics say the gap may undermine the argument that the program as it currently exists can provide peace of mind about links to potential terrorists: a negative result might instead mean only that the data was missing.

Supporters however say the gap might undermine the argument that the program is ineffective because it has thwarted no attacks and uncovered only a minor case in which some men sent several thousand dollars to a Somali terrorist group.

“We should have a debate about how effective would it be if it were fully implemented” one official said.

In a speech last month Mr. Obama announced that he intended to find a way to get the government out of the business of holding onto the bulk records but he also said that its capabilities should be preserved.

Mr. Obama also announced that he wanted to immediately impose new limits on how the database is used by requiring the N.S.A. to wait for a judge on the surveillance court to sign off before querying records associated with a number that is suspected of links to terrorism — except in emergencies — and by limiting analysts to only pulling up records of people who are up to two levels removed from that number.

Previously the surveillance court had allowed the N.S.A. to decide that a search was justified and had let analysts go up to three levels out — meaning an exponentially larger number of people’s calls would be scrutinized.

On Wednesday according to a statement issued late Thursday in the name of James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence the surveillance court issued an order amending the rules in line with Mr. Obama’s proposed changes.

On Friday a judicial clerk announced that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had made his first selection to the main Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court since Mr. Snowden’s revelations about spy programs that had been secretly approved by the court.

The leaks have focused greater attention on how Chief Justice Roberts has used his unilateral authority to select judges to serve seven-year terms on the court. Of the 11 judges currently serving — all appointed by Chief Justice Roberts — 10 had been appointed to judgeships on other federal courts by Republican presidents.

But in May when the term expires for Judge Reggie B. Walton of the District of Columbia Chief Justice Roberts has selected an Obama appointee Judge James E. Boasberg also of the District of Columbia to fill the position until 2021. Judge Boasberg a former federal prosecutor was appointed to the Federal District Court by Mr. Obama in 2011. He has handled several cases involving national security and secrecy matters since joining the court.

In 2012 for example he sided with the Central Intelligence Agency and rejected a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking public disclosure of photographs of the corpse and burial of Osama Bin Laden.

But last year Judge Boasberg ruled against the Department of Homeland Security saying it had to release documents explaining a secret policy about the government’s ability to shut down commercial and private wireless network services in certain circumstances. The Obama administration has appealed the ruling.

Chief Justice Roberts also selected Judge Richard C. Tallman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to fill a vacancy on the three-member review panel that hears rare appeals of the surveillance court’s rulings.

While Judge Tallman was appointed by President Bill Clinton his nomination was part of a political deal over judicial nominations in which his seat would go to a person acceptable to Senator Slade Gorton Republican of Washington.

Several members of Congress have proposed changing the way judges are selected to serve on the court to achieve greater ideological diversity in light of its evolving role and growing power and Mr. Obama’s surveillance review group also recommended doing so."
_GOVT_SURV,Jun__5_2015_US_government_responds_to_latest_hack:_give_us_more_power_over_data_collection.txt,"Congressional leaders are warning the latest major government data hack proves the Senate should hand the US government greater cybersecurity powers – even as the stalled legislation to do so would place even more consumer data into the hands of the same government that could not secure its existing information.

An estimated 4 million federal employees had their personal data compromised after what was reported by authorities on Thursday to be a previously unknown software intrusion known as a “zero day” attack accessed networks operated by the Office of Personnel Management the federal human resources department that houses high-level security clearances and government employee records.

The latest data breach prompted calls from bipartisan leaders of the House intelligence committee for the Senate to pass the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (Cisa) the Senate counterpart of a House bill the Protecting Cyber Networks Act that the House approved in April 307-116.

But cybersecurity experts and technologists questioned the wisdom of turning over vast new amounts of private data to the government after another massive exposure of federal government data insecurity. The additional powers sought by the government are a major legislative priority for the National Security Agency which would gain access to new private data particularly from financial firms via the Department of Homeland Security.

“The government must take fast decisive measures to counter these intrusions which emanate from hostile nation-states as well as non-state actors” the chairman of the committee California Republican Devin Nunes said on Friday. “The House of Representatives has sought to strengthen our cyber defenses by approving the Protecting Cyber Networks Act and the Senate urgently needs to pass the bill.”

Lynn Westmoreland the Georgia Republican who chairs the cybersecurity subcommittee added: “Business and industry leaders warned us of the growing threats during various hearings and this attack shows why the Senate needs to move quickly on a cyber bill.”

On Thursday the subcommittee’s co-chair Democrat Adam Schiff of California sounded a similar alarm: “The cyber threat from hackers criminals terrorists and state actors is one of the greatest challenges we face on a daily bases and it’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue. That’s why the House moved forward on cybersecurity legislation earlier this year and it’s my hope that this latest incident will spur the Senate to action.”

Related: Cyberwar: hacking attacks between nations are difficult to prove

The new breach however “undercuts the arguments for Cisa” said Eli Dourado of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

“We’ve been saying for months now that the federal government just sucks at cybersecurity.”

The “information-sharing” bills which have stalled in the Senate would expand legal protections for private businesses to share threat patterns of malicious intrusions with the federal government. Privacy advocates have warned since the legislation’s introduction that the nature of cyber threats will require a substantial amount of customer and private data also being provided to the government without adequate privacy protections.

Senator Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee who voted against Cisa said on Friday that the bill threatened American privacy.

“It is unlikely that information sharing by private companies would have made any significant difference in protecting federal employee data” Wyden said in a statement. “That’s why cybersecurity experts say that passing a bill like this will do little to reduce security breaches.

“This is a bad excuse to try and pass a bad bill.”

A coalition of dozens of civil-society groups and cybersecurity experts noted in an April letter that US agencies will “automatically disseminate to the NSA all cyber threat indicators they receive including personal information about individuals” under the bill.

In April the Mercatus Center at George Mason University noted in a report that the past year has been “the worst year for federal information security failures on record”. An estimated 67196 actual or detected security breaches occurred in fiscal 2014 the report found.

“Importantly” the Mercatus Center found “the agencies that would be entrusted with significant new data extraction and management responsibilities under Cisa reported alarming security breaches last year.”

In the past year the homeland security department which leads the government’s efforts to secure its own networks reported 1816 “pieces of computer equipment lost or stolen” the report found.

Justice Department employees were fooled into downloading malicious software 182 times a total dwarfed by malware downloads that occurred 370 times at the significantly larger Department of Defense another wing of government with significant cybersecurity equities and responsibilities. Additionally a September 2014 report from the cybersecurity firm McAfee Labs noted that such so-called “phishing” attacks are increasing in sophistication.

The prospect of unreported or undetected network breaches means the actual picture of federal cyber vulnerability is likely even more dire than the reported statistics.

“Information-sharing agencies already exist. We’ve identified 20. Nobody knows how cybersecurity works but they’ve all decided that information-sharing is the answer. You’ve got to wonder if that’s really more about surveillance than about actual cybersecurity since it doesn’t appear to be working” Dourado said.

Patrick Eddington of the libertarian Cato Institute added: “The notion that the federal government should get still more personal information from Americans as part of a misguided centralized legislative response to cyber incidents is insane. That approach puts Americans at more not less risk of having their personal information compromised.”

James Lewis a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that private banks spend lavishly on security and still get hacked.

“The ‘government’ doesn’t do any worse than companies and in some ways they do better. US law splits the responsibility – civilian agencies are protected by DHS national security agencies are protected by NSA. The Chinese succeeded against DHS but not NSA” Lewis said. Authorities suspect but have not demonstrated Chinese culpability for the newest attack.

“We need to rethink this split responsibility when it comes to information sharing. It’s OK to say NSA shouldn’t play a bigger role as long as you’re willing to accept things like the OPM hack happening over and over again.”



The Department of Homeland Security said in a Thursday statement that its automated system for cyber intrusions Einstein identified the intrusion evidently after the data had been exfiltrated. By its nature Einstein does not identify previously unknown “zero day” threat patterns which is key to the contention – by the architects of the legislation themselves – that the government needs additional threat data from private firms that detect new threats.

A homeland security spokesman SY Lee declined to elaborate on an ongoing investigation of the hack."
_GOVT_SURV,Jul__1_2015_Surveillance_Court_Rules_That_N.S.A._Can_Resume_Bulk_Data_Collection.txt,"Photo

WASHINGTON — The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled late Monday that the National Security Agency may temporarily resume its once-secret program that systematically collects records of Americans’ domestic phone calls in bulk.

But the American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday that it would ask the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which had ruled that the surveillance program was illegal to issue an injunction to halt the program setting up a potential conflict between the two courts.

The program lapsed on June 1 when a law on which it was based Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act expired. Congress revived that provision on June 2 with a bill called the USA Freedom Act which said the provision could not be used for bulk collection after six months.

The six-month period was intended to give intelligence agencies time to move to a new system in which the phone records — which include information like phone numbers and the duration of calls but not the contents of conversations — would stay in the hands of phone companies. Under those rules the agency would still be able to gain access to the records to analyze links between callers and suspected terrorists.

But complicating matters in May the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York ruled in a lawsuit brought by the A.C.L.U. that Section 215 of the Patriot Act could not legitimately be interpreted as permitting bulk collection at all.

Congress did not include language in the Freedom Act contradicting the Second Circuit ruling or authorizing bulk collection even for the six-month transition. As a result it was unclear whether the program had a lawful basis to resume in the interim.

After President Obama signed the Freedom Act on June 2 his administration applied to restart the program for six months. But a conservative and libertarian advocacy group FreedomWorks filed a motion in the surveillance court saying it had no legal authority to permit the program to resume even for the interim period.

In a 26-page opinion made public on Tuesday Judge Michael W. Mosman of the surveillance court rejected the challenge by FreedomWorks which was represented by a former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli a Republican. And Judge Mosman said the Second Circuit was wrong too.

“Second Circuit rulings are not binding” on the surveillance court he wrote “and this court respectfully disagrees with that court’s analysis especially in view of the intervening enactment of the USA Freedom Act.”

When the Second Circuit issued its ruling that the program was illegal it did not issue any injunction ordering the program halted saying it would be prudent to see what Congress did as Section 215 neared its June 1 expiration. Jameel Jaffer an A.C.L.U. lawyer said on Tuesday that the group would now ask for one.

“Neither the statute nor the Constitution permits the government to subject millions of innocent people to this kind of intrusive surveillance” Mr. Jaffer said. “We intend to ask the court to prohibit the surveillance and to order the N.S.A. to purge the records it’s already collected.”

The bulk phone records program traces back to October 2001 when the Bush administration secretly authorized the N.S.A. to collect records of Americans’ domestic phone calls in bulk as part of a broader set of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism efforts.

The program began on the basis of presidential power alone. In 2006 the Bush administration persuaded the surveillance court to begin blessing it under of Section 215 of the Patriot Act which says the government may collect records that are “relevant” to a national security investigation.

The program was declassified in June 2013 after its existence was disclosed by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden.

It remains unclear whether the Second Circuit still considers the surveillance program to be illegal during this six-month transition period. The basis for its ruling in May was that Congress had never intended for Section 215 to authorize bulk collection.

In his ruling Judge Mosman said that because Congress knew how the surveillance court was interpreting Section 215 when it passed the Freedom Act lawmakers implicitly authorized bulk collection to resume for the transition period.

“Congress could have prohibited bulk data collection” effective immediately he wrote. “Instead after lengthy public debate and with crystal-clear knowledge of the fact of ongoing bulk collection of call detail records” it chose to allow a 180-day transitional period during which such collection could continue he wrote.

The surveillance court is subject to review by its own appeals panel the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. Both the Second Circuit and the surveillance review court are in turn subject to the Supreme Court which resolves conflicts between appeals courts.

Wyn Hornbuckle a Justice Department spokesman said in a written statement that the Obama administration agreed with Judge Mosman.

Since the program was made public plaintiffs have filed several lawsuits before regular courts which hear arguments from each side before issuing rulings unlike the surveillance court’s usual practice which is to hear only from the government. Judge Mosman’s disagreement with the Second Circuit is the second time that the surveillance court has rejected a contrary ruling about the program by a judge in the regular court system.

In a lawsuit challenging the program that was brought by the conservative legal advocate Larry Klayman Judge Richard J. Leon of Federal District Court in the District of Columbia ruled in December 2013 that the program most likely violated the Fourth Amendment which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.

But in March 2014 Judge Rosemary M. Collyer a Federal District Court judge who also sits on the secret surveillance court rejected Judge Leon’s reasoning and permitted the program to keep going. The Obama administration has appealed Judge Leon’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The Freedom Act also contains a provision saying that whenever the surveillance court addresses a novel and significant legal issue it must either appoint an outside “friend of the court” who can offer arguments contrary to what the government is saying or explain why appointing one is not appropriate.

The first test of that reform came last month when another judge on the court F. Dennis Saylor IV addressed a separate issue raised by the passage of the Freedom Act. Judge Saylor acknowledged that it was novel and significant but declined to appoint an outside advocate saying the answer to the legal question was “sufficiently clear” to him without hearing from one."
_GOVT_SURV,Jan_16_2014_NSA:_six_out_of_10_Americans_want_reform_of_data_collection_says_poll.txt,"Fears are growing among civil libertarians that Barack Obama will allow the National Security Agency to retain its bulk databases of US phone call information despite new polling that indicates substantial public appetite for restricting the spy agency’s powers.

A poll by the Anzalone Liszt Grove Research firm released Thursday finds 59% of Americans oppose keeping the NSA’s widespread collection of data unchanged. Twenty-six percent of respondents “strongly” oppose keeping NSA current surveillance in place.

A majority of respondents 57% say they have “not much” confidence in the government’s ability to prevent abuse of the NSA’s troves of US phone records. Similarly 58% doubt that the government can keep the data safe from hackers.

That scepticism of the NSA echoes concern voiced earlier this week by Geoffrey Stone a law professor and member of Obama’s surveillance review panel which recommended taking the bulk collection out of the hands of the NSA. “Government can do far more harm if it abuses information it has than private entities can” Stone told the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday.

The findings also come the day before President Obama is set to deliver a major speech outlining his perspectives on the proper scope of NSA data collection. Civil libertarians once hopeful that Obama would end the bulk collection of all records of calls made in the United States are bracing for disappointment after a New York Times report suggested Obama would allow the NSA to maintain its sweeping databases when he makes his speech on Friday.

But congressional critics are already gearing up for a fight to end the bulk collection legislatively preparing to fight a president who had yet to clearly indicate which side of the argument he would pick.

“The ball is in Congress’s court. In order to fix the NSA rein in abuse and restore trust in the intelligence community we need a legislative solution” Representative James Sensenbrenner a Wisconsin Republican told the Guardian.

Sensenbrenner is the chief House co-author of a bill to end bulk phone data collection known as the USA Freedom Act. Sensenbrenner a longtime member of the House judiciary committee said he was confident that it would receive the backing of his fellow lawmakers. “If brought up for a vote it would pass with broad bipartisan support” he said.

Representative Justin Amash a Michigan Republican who led a revolt in July to stop the mass surveillance which came close to succeeding told the Guardian that the widespread controversy over the NSA’s reach meant that Obama “will not get away with mere cosmetic changes to the government's domestic spying program”.

Amash said: “Either he favours spying on every person's communications or he doesn't. Americans are outraged by domestic spying and they will watch the president's actions closely.”

The White House’s official position is that Obama has yet to conclusively decide which spy powers he wants to restrict and which he wants to reaffirm. Numerous surveillance insiders said this week that they had not been briefed on concrete White House proposals and indicated that the debate remains fluid.

But the proposal to strip the NSA of its databases has hit a snag of opposition from telecommunications firms who do not want to be required to hold customer data for longer than their current average 18 month maximum fearing legal and financial liability. The NSA wants any searchable database of phone records held either by itself or a private entity to contain at least three years’ worth of data to help it and the FBI detect connections to terrorism.

That civil libertarians argue would outsource mass surveillance rather than end it.

Another idea under discussion would be to have a non-telecoms firm become the new data repository – an idea that privacy advocates and the NSA may find discomforting.

Insiders suggest two potential models for a non-telecom private database. One would have a military information-technology firm become a metadata repository – a solution tinged with irony since NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden whose leaks prompted the reform discussion worked for contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

Another would be modelled on a firm like Neustar which maintains a database of routing instructions called the Number Portability Administration Center which among other things allows phone customers who switch carriers to retain their phone numbers.

Neustar a former Lockheed Martin subsidiary is a “neutral third party” that works with the phone companies on infrastructure issues said communications director Kim Hart who added that the firm had not itself been approached by the government about becoming a storehouse of phone metadata.

Privacy advocates were sceptical of a new expansive phone records database fearing that “creating a large honeypot of private data” would be difficult to keep secure from hackers and would not actually end bulk surveillance said Kevin Bankston of the Open Technology Institute.

“If the president comes out in favor of mandatory data retention either by a provider or a third party that would require legislation such that we may very quickly be in trench warfare on that issue” Bankston said.

Amash said he hoped Obama “will work with us constructively” but signaled that a legislative battle may be the ultimate resolution of the post-Snowden debate after Obama makes his speech on Friday at the Justice Department.

""Congress must protect Americans' privacy regardless of what the President does” Amash said."
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Jan__8_2014_Cyberbullying:_increasing_number_of_children_suffering_says_ChildLine.txt,"The number of children suffering at the hands of cyberbullies has sharply increased with victims often left in despair and struggling to cope according to ChildLine.

The charity saw 4507 cases of cyberbullying in 2012-13 up from 2410 in 2011-12 with an 87% rise in contacts about online bullying a 41% increase in contacts about self-harm and a 33% increase in young people feeling suicidal.

The charity has also seen a sharp rise in racist bullying online with more than 1400 young people telling ChildLine they had been called among other insults a terrorist bomber or had been told to go back where they came from – a 69% increase on last year.

Self-harm was a major concern said ChildLine – being mentioned in 47000 counselling sessions a 41% year-on-year increase. The number of 12-year-olds mentioning self-harm also increased by 50%.

The founder of ChildLine Esther Rantzen said the report had to act as a wake-up call. ""Far too many of the nation's children seem to be struggling and in despair. It's so important that we support children to talk about issues and look out for signs that they're not able to cope.

""No matter how hard pressed we are we must commit to giving children time and space to talk about their lives. If they are concealing unhappiness encourage them to open up and if they can't talk to you maybe they can talk to ChildLine.""

The CEO of the NSPCC Peter Wanless said the issues facing children today were different from those experienced by their parents. He said: ""Stranger danger for example rarely comes up in contacts to ChildLine but depression self-harm online bullying and even suicide contacts are increasing exponentially. If we are to help young people we need to listen to what they are telling us about the issues they are facing.""

The charity plans to regularly publish all its data around calls to enable children's voices to be heard he said. ""ChildLine is one of the most important sources of information about vulnerable children in the UK and these regular snapshots will help us to keep one step ahead and focused on the areas that are concerning them.""

The ChildLine figures come a week after the Prince's Trust said as many as 750000 young people in the UK may feel they have nothing to live for citing high unemployment rates among young people as a significant factor.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said every school had to have measures in place by law to prevent cyberbullying. ""Thanks to our new curriculum children will soon be taught how to stay safe online including cyberbullying from the age of five. We have strengthened the powers teachers have to tackle bullying. They can search pupils for banned items delete inappropriate images from phones and give out same-day detentions"" she said.

ChildLine was launched in 1986 and has counselled about 3.2 million children.

_HARMFUL_TRTH,Feb__9_2016_Internet_trolling:_quarter_of_teenagers_suffered_online_abuse_last_year.txt,"One in four teenagers suffered hate incidents online last year a figure described by experts as a “wake-up call” on the impact of internet trolling.

The survey of 13- to 18-year-olds found that 24% had been targeted due to their gender sexual orientation race religion disability or transgender identity. One in 25 said they were singled out for abuse all or most of the time.

Will Gardner chief executive of the charity Childnet and director of the UK Safer Internet Centre which published the study said: “It is a wake-up call for all of us to play our part in helping create a better internet for all to ensure that everyone can benefit from the opportunities that technology provides for building mutual respect and dialogue facilitating rights and empowering everyone to be able to express themselves and be themselves online – whoever they are.”

The survey also found four in five adolescents had seen or heard online hate during the previous 12 months. Researchers defined such abuse as offensive mean or threatening and either targeted directly at a person or group or generally shared online.

Teenagers with disabilities and those from African Caribbean Asian Middle Eastern and other minority ethnic groups were more likely to encounter cyberbullying the report concluded.

The survey of more than 1500 teenagers was published to mark Safer Internet Day.

Of those questioned 41% said online hate had increased in the past year. Social media was found to be the most common platform in which young people witnessed such abuse which in some instances can be classified as a hate crime.

However the majority of respondents said victims had received support online with 93% saying they had seen their friends post supportive content last year.

Gardner said: “While it is encouraging to see that almost all young people believe no one should be targeted with online hate and heartening to hear about the ways young people are using technology to take positive action online to empower each other and spread kindness we were surprised and concerned to see that so many had been exposed to online hate in the last year.”

Liam Hackett chief executive of Ditch the Label an anti-bullying charity said cyberbullying should not be treated separately but as an “extension of bullying”. “We have to understand why people bully online to help them stop. There is a lot of emphasis on reactive support but no consideration made to how we can tackle bullying proactively” he said.

“There’s a lot of research to show disempowerment offline or stressful and traumatic experiences can lead young people to troll and that the possibility of anonymity had allowed cyberbullying to increase.”

The education secretary Nicky Morgan said: “The internet is a powerful tool which can have brilliant and virtually limitless benefits but it must be used sensibly and safely. We are working hard to make the web a safer place for children but we can’t do it alone and parents have a vital role to play in educating young people.”

Convictions for crimes under a law to prosecute internet trolls increased eightfold in a decade according to data published last year with 155 people jailed for sending messages or other material which was “grossly offensive or of an indecent obscene or menacing character”."
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Oct_19_2013_Mother_in_Florida_cyber-bullying_case_faces_separate_child_abuse_charges.txt,"An outspoken Florida sheriff who arrested a 14-year-old girl for cyber-bullying after a younger schoolmate killed herself has filed child abuse charges against her mother over an unrelated incident.

Polk County sheriff Grady Judd said Vivien Lee Vosburg 30 punched and shouted obscenities at several children in her care in a violent incident in June that was captured on video and later posted to Facebook by one of the children.

Vosburg's daughter Guadelupe Shaw was one of two girls arrested and charged with aggravated stalking earlier this week over the death of Rebecca Sedwick 12 a schoolgirl who killed herself last month after an alleged campaign of online harassment.

Shaw who was charged alongside Sedwick's classmate Katelyn Roman 12 allegedly posted a Facebook status update after the girl threw herself from a silo tower at a concrete plant that read: ""Yes I bullied Rebecca and she killed herself but I don't give a fuck.""

In an interview earlier this week Vosburg defended her daughter calling her ""lovable and caring"" and claiming: ""She wouldn't write anything like that.""

Judd said he rejected Vosburg's account of family life after watching the video in which she apparently strikes at least two of the children in the head with a closed fist one of them repeatedly and in which she and others are heard swearing with impunity.

""This clearly indicates to us that this appears to be a normal way of life"" said Judd who has declared a ""zero tolerance"" approach to cyber-bullying in his county. ""They're laughing and cussing and throwing the F-bomb around then they're posting that conduct for all to see. It is clear not only has Vosburg demonstrated she cannot control the behaviour of children she has access to without using violence but she is obviously not monitoring the social media sites of children she has access to either.

""I'm astounded by this conduct I'm astounded that it was posted and then I'm even more astounded that it stayed there.""

Of Guadelupe Shaw Judd said: ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.""

According to a press release from Judd's office Vosburg of Lakeland at first told detectives she was trying to break up a fight and said she hit the children accidentally. But after viewing the video: ""Vosburg stated she knew she should not have hit the juveniles with her fists.""

""At first she said 'I accidentally hit him' and then she said 'The two boys were seriously fighting and then well I was having a bad day'"" Judd said. ""Later she added 'Well I did go too far that day. It got out of hand'.""

The mother ""has access"" to all six juveniles seen during the minute-long video the press release said and Florida Department of Children and Family investigators visited all of them at their schools on Friday.

Shaw and Roman were released to the custody of their parents earlier in the week pending court appearances on the stalking charges. Vosburg was being held on Saturday without bond at the Polk County jail."
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Sep_22_2015_One_in_five_young_people_has_suffered_online_abuse_study_finds.txt,"Cyberbullying is a worse problem among teenagers than drug abuse according to almost half of all young people surveyed in a new study that finds one in five has experienced online abuse.

In the global YouGov survey of more than 4700 teenagers from across the world a fifth of those who had experienced cyberbullying said it had made them consider suicide and more than half said being taunted online was worse than being bullied in person.

A quarter of those bullied closed down social media accounts and more than a fifth skipped school the survey commissioned by Vodafone found. Of those who were bullied almost 40% did not tell their parents citing feelings of shame or fear.



Researchers spoke to 13- to 18-year-olds from the UK Germany Italy Spain Netherlands New Zealand Greece South Africa US Ireland and the Czech Republic.

Of the British children surveyed more than half of those bullied said it had negatively affected their self-esteem though fewer than one in five said they had been targeted and most thought face-to-face bullying was more upsetting.

New Zealand had the highest number of teenagers who said they had experienced cyberbullying followed by the US and Iceland.

The director of the Vodafone Foundation Andrew Dunnett which is giving £100000 to anti-bullying charities said the results would be a “serious concern for any parent”.

“The new generation that was born digital thrives in a world of constant connectivity but there are clear risks for young people as well as benefits – and it is striking that cyberbullying troubles many young people more than drug abuse” he continued.

The phone giant has released a set of new emojis selected by the surveyed teens as part of an anti-bullying initiative as a wordless way for social media users to express support for those being tormented online. The initiative was the brainchild of Monica Lewinsky the former White House intern turned campaigner who gave a widely shared TED talk where she referred to herself as “patient zero” of online-shaming culture after her affair with then-President Bill Clinton.

“It may seem like a small action but showing support and compassion to someone online who is being cyberbullied or harassed has a large impact” Lewinsky said in a statement for the the campaign’s launch. “The initiative is one of the myriad ways we can begin to shift the online culture.”

“What can be challenging is for people particularly when they are young can find it hard to show support for friends who are being bullied publicly online because they fear they’ll be bullied themselves or they simply struggle to find the right words” said Berkeley University psychologist Prof Dacher Keltner who developed the emojis along with charity The Diana Award and Enable a EU anti-bullying project.

“Images can be more powerful for them to use to show support or compassion” he said.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dacher Keltner psychologist adviser on Pixar film Inside Out explains why emojis can help tell victims of cyberbullying that they are not alone.

The majority of the young people surveyed said they found a combination of words and emojis the best way to express their feelings rather than words alone though only one in 10 said using pictures alone was easiest.

Last year research at the London School of Economics found cyberbullying was now more common than face-to-face bullying and almost a third of those surveyed said they had seen negative or abusive online content including hate messages and self-harm sites.

But in a separate report last November a survey by mental health charity YoungMinds found parents were more worried about drug and alcohol use by their teenagers whereas youngsters said mental health cyberbullying and jobs were the biggest worries in their lives.

A Department for Education spokesperson said the government was taking action to tackle cyberbullying including £7m in resources for schools to tackle bullying.

“We have strengthened teachers’ powers to tackle bullying by giving them the freedom to search for and delete inappropriate images from phones and other electronic devices” a spokesman said. “We have also made clear that teachers can discipline and investigate cases of bullying outside school.”

_HARMFUL_TRTH,Apr_29_2015_Data_Company_Unearthed_Twitter’s_Earnings_Early.txt,"Selerity a financial analytics firm recently released a study about how news events break on Twitter. On Tuesday however Selerity made news about Twitter.

Three seconds before 3:08 p.m. on Tuesday Selerity tweeted what looked to be an early release of Twitter’s disappointing earnings release nearly an hour before Twitter was scheduled to announce it to Wall Street.

Six seconds later Selerity says shares of Twitter plunged. The New York Stock Exchange briefly halted Twitter trading as the company sorted out the mess. By 4 p.m. when the markets closed the stock had fallen nearly 20 percent.

This is the business of Selerity. It combs the Internet for any signs of early financial information from companies like Twitter and offers its services to high-frequency traders who could potentially act quickly to make money on that information.

But it also serves as a reminder — albeit an expensive one in some cases — of just how quickly information can spread across the Internet only moments after it is published and what it can mean for the companies involved."
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Aug__9_2013_Cyberbullying:_a_mother's_fight_for_justice.txt,"When Liese Stanley saw the messages that her then 13-year-old daughter had received on the social network Ask.fm she felt sick with shock. This wasn't normal bullying. Her daughter wasn't being called too fat or too thin or criticised for her choice in music. She was being threatened with a sadistic rape attack. Her abuser also threatened to attack the schoolgirl with a hammer ""to cave in the back of your head"".

Stanley's story is almost certainly not unique. This week Ask.fm has faced a barrage of criticism for failing to tackle cyberbullying on its site after the suicide of 14-year-old Hannah Smith.

On Wednesday police investigating abusive and explicit messages posted on Twitter to a series of high-profile women including the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy and the feminist writer Caroline Criado-Perez made a third arrest.

But how do you get justice if you are a mother and your 13-year-old has been targeted in the way Stanley's child has been?

You don't says Stanley.

""It's so frustrating. When you talk to police and they say they can't do anything because the company is based in Latvia when each organisation sends you to someone else and says it is not their responsibility you feel completely helpless completely let down.""

She describes her first reaction to first reading the abuse: ""You feel sick and incredibly protective and vulnerable you want to protect your daughter from this but actually you can't do anything"" she says. ""Parents are told they have to be aware of what their kids are doing online but we had already had those discussions.""

Her anger grew as she found herself repeatedly ignored and redirected by various organisations she thought might help. Avon and Somerset police said the threats were some of the worst online abuse they had seen but they could not take further action as the site was based in Latvia. ChildLine referred her to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop).

The children's commissioner's office wrote: ""We will be forwarding your email to [Ceop] which is part of UK law enforcement and as such can apply the full range of policing powers in tackling the sexual abuse of children.""

Stanley received an email from the children's commissioner in June which included a response from Ceop which stated: ""We have tried reaching out to this company before but received no response. The reporting person appears to be reaching out as they are not satisfied with what the police achieved however there is nothing further Ceop will be able to do as as stated Ceop have not been able to establish contact with Ask.fm either.""

A Ceop spokeswoman told the Guardian that cyberbullying was not in its remit but it supported ""partner organisations"" such as the NSPCC's ChildLine and BeatBullying. She said Ceop received ""a relatively large number of referrals"" about Ask.fm mainly concerning bullying but also in relation to sexual chat and imagery. ""Ceop will investigate any cases where it is clear that a child is at risk of sexual abuse or where a child sex offence is discussed or disclosed and this appears to be a rare occurrence on Ask.fm"" she said.

For Stanley this was another example of an organisation passing the buck. ""Everyone agrees that this is a terrible thing but children are killing themselves and absolutely nothing is being done"" she says.

This week fresh from his holiday the prime minister condemned Ask.fm and called for a boycott. But Stanley remains sceptical. ""David Cameron says he's going to crack down on these things but it's just good soundbites"" she says. ""That might help you win an election but it doesn't help me.""

By Thursday this week advertisers such as Specsavers and Vodafone were pulling their advertising from Ask.fm which – after days of near radio silence – issued a long statement.

It stressed that the site had a report button for abuse questions could only be published when answered users could choose not to receive anonymous questions and it had a ""team of human moderators that works around the clock … ensuring that anything of a sexual pornographic or violent nature is removed."" It also sought to ""reassure parents that in almost all cases it is possible for Ask.fm to identify users"" adding that in ""extreme circumstances – such as those we have experienced this week"" it would work with authorities. On Friday it announced that law firm Mishcon de Reya would conduct ""a full and independent audit of our site and its safety features"".

Stanley repeatedly emailed Ask.fm starting in November asking what action it would take whether the abuser would be banned and whether their details would be sent to the police. She also asked for a copy of its guidelines on abuse.

Ask.fm responded in November: ""Hello. Sorry but we can not give this kind of information. By the way it is possible to block anonymous questions or select 'Do not allow anonymous questions' in privacy settings. With love ask.fm team.""

To another request for the guidelines it replied: ""Sorry for misunderstanding. We collect all the cases regarding abuses and investigate it asap. So if you have any complaints please feel free to send it to us.""

Stanley has sent eight emails and she says the company no longer replies. It did finally remove the abuse her daughter received without notifying her weeks after it had been reported.

Stanley also emailed Google whose AdSense advertising platform is used on the site and says she received no response. A Google spokesman said the company considered every complaint made to it but only gave out automated responses when complaints about sites where it hosted adverts were received.

""We don't have any incentive to serve ads on webpages that break our policies"" the spokesman said. ""It is not good for our users our advertisers or us. When we receive a complaint we review the site in question and take action if necessary.""

With few options left Stanley decided to take matters into her own hands contacting companies that advertised on the site directly. ""My daughter and her friends just said this is what happens online they just accept it"" she says. ""But the thing that keeps me going is the thought that this just isn't right it's hideous. These sites are happy to take advertisers' money but show no responsibility to their users.""

Some of the companies she emailed – including British Airways Thomson Cruises Parent magazine the National Accident Helpline Oxfam and Nottingham Trent University – replied saying the adverts had in the main been placed with an agency often via Google's AdSense and promising not to advertise on Ask.fm again.

The vice-president of BonitaSoft a business solutions firm wrote back personally saying: ""I am the father to two young children and take the issue of bullying and threats very seriously … I have researched this site and found many things I do not like. I have instructed our advertising operations manager to remove our advertising from Ask.fm.""

Others such as Asda and McDonald's sent only an automated reply but Stanley felt she was getting somewhere. Months later she feels that her battle to be heard has been an uphill struggle but she is not giving up. She is considering setting up a Twitter campaign calling for other affected parents to target advertisers.

""It's sad that money talks more than a 13-year-old girl being threatened with rape and murder"" she says. ""And it's scary that I feel I have to do this by myself but I will keep plugging away.""

Thanks for taking the time to contact us. Your feedback is important to us as it allows us to keep improving our products and services to ensure we are getting it right. We aim to respond to all emails within 2-3 working days. Asda

I have made sure our partner company are aware of this – they have apologised reassured us it is an extremely rare occurrence and removed it immediately from their network. I'd like to apologise again for this and reiterate our thanks for bringing this to our attention. Thomson Cruises

We have blocked that site from our re-marketing list with Google so we won't appear on there again. Additionally we have highlighted the site as an issue with Google. I hope this information is helpful. Again I am sorry that your daughter has had to endure such threats. Oxfam

I am a vice-president at BonitaSoft and responsible for all advertising operations. I thank you for your note. I am the father to two young children and take the issue of bullying and threats very seriously. You were correct in pointing out that our advertisements may have shown up on Ask.fm due to our advertising programs with Google. We do not specifically choose where our ads show on the Google network. However any site that has a bad reputation like [Ask.fm] is not where I want our company brand displayed. I have researched this site and found many things I do not like. I have instructed our advertising operations manager to remove our advertising from Ask.fm. Mac McConnell of BonitaSoft

We would like to wish you and you daughter all the best in the future and hope that you and your daughter receive the justice you both deserve for the terrible experience your daughter has suffered. National Accident Helpline

At British Airways we have strict guidelines which govern where we place our advertisements. We do not and have never advertised on Ask.fm or any other unregulated website. In this case it appears that an agency working for one of our partners accidentally placed an advert on the site. As soon as we alerted them this was immediately rectified. British Airways

We have discussed the matter with our network providers and have asked them to exclude Ask.fm from our marketing campaigns moving forwards. American Golf"
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Jun_28_2016_Dutch_court_to_extradite_man_accused_of_cyberbullying_teen_who_killed_herself.txt,"An Amsterdam court has ruled in favour of extraditing a Dutchman to Canada where he is wanted on charges linked to the cyberbullying of a teenager who killed herself in 2012.

Identified only by his first name because of Dutch privacy rules Aydin C “who is linked to the suicide of 15-year-old Amanda Todd may be extradited to Canada” the court said in a statement.

Although the extradition request did not relate to charges in connection with Todd’s suicide Aydin C was suspected by Canadian law enforcement of committing diverse sexual offences with Todd it said.

“The court found that the reasons for the extradition request relates to punishable offences in both Canada and the Netherlands involving a possible jail term of longer than one year” the court added.

Prosecutors allege that Aydin C 38 blackmailed dozens of girls on the internet into performing lewd acts threatening to post videos of earlier sex acts if they failed to comply.

A wide-ranging case against Aydin C who was arrested in January 2014 is already ongoing in the Netherlands involving 39 victims including from Canada.

He is suspected of forcing dozens of young women from as far afield as the United States Britain and the Netherlands into performing sex acts in front of their webcams.

Aydin C is also linked to the case of Todd who killed herself in October 2012 after being tormented by an anonymous cyberbully.

The teenager’s death sparked a debate in Canada and worldwide about appropriate online behaviour and prompted calls for bullying to be criminalised.

In a YouTube video watched by millions worldwide Todd said before her death that she had anxiety “major depression” and panic attacks after a photo of her breasts flashed in an online video chat with a stranger was distributed in her community.

She said she withdrew from those around her and turned to drugs and alcohol and “cried every night”.

In the video Todd said she lost friends was beaten up in a schoolyard over a boy and had to change schools several times to escape blackmail.

Aydin C however will be sent to Canada only after the end of his trial in the Netherlands which is due to start in early 2017 the court said.

_HARMFUL_TRTH,Dec_17_2008_US_cyberbullying_laws_do_little_to_deter_behaviour_experts_say.txt,"Her enemies nicknamed her ""Pork and Beans"". Eggs and thumbtacks were thrown at her car in August police say. A week later the 16-year-old St Peters Missouri girl found a can of beans dumped on the car's roof.

Text messages spurred by jealousy over a boy soon filled the girl's mobile phone. Then came vulgar voice mails; one caller even threatening rape.

As a result prosecutors used a new cyber harassment law to charge a 21-year-old St Charles woman.

Nicole A Williams is charged with misdemeanour harassment. She is accused of sending harassing text messages to the girl and letting friends use her mobile phone to leave threatening voice messages.

Her case is one of at least seven involving adults in the St Louis area filed since Missouri's new cyberbullying law took effect August 28.

Williams' is the first harassment case involving text messaging filed in St Charles County under the new law.

Eighteen states now have laws targeting internet harassment and cyberstalking according to the national conference of state legislatures. In the fallout of the cyberbullying case of Dardenne Prairie Missouri teenager Megan Meier legal experts say the long-term impact of such laws is just beginning to take shape.

Illinois lawmakers passed a similar law this year but it doesn't take effect until January 1. The law includes prohibiting a website with third-party access that contains ""harassing statements made for the purpose of alarming tormenting or terrorizing a specific person"".

Missouri's updated harassment law covers threats or communication that causes emotional distress including electronic messaging on computers text messaging and email. Charges can be filed as misdemeanours or felonies.

Williams' lawyer Michael Kielty said she shouldn't be punished for what others may have said or written using her mobile phone.

Missouri's cyberbullying law Kielty says is poorly defined and was passed hastily in response to the case of Meier 13 who hanged herself in October 2006 after receiving hurtful messages over the social networking website MySpace.com.

""It's a knee-jerk reaction to a high-profile case that was blown out of proportion"" Kielty said.

Last month a Los Angeles jury found Lori Drew 49 of O'Fallon Missouri guilty of three misdemeanour counts of accessing a computer without authorisation for her role in the creation of a fake MySpace account.

Drew faces up to three years in prison and a $300000 fine.

Prosecutors in California where MySpace is headquartered charged Drew under the Computer Use and Fraud Act which has typically been used in computer hacking cases. St Louis area authorities said there were no applicable laws at the time to charge her.

Some experts say that even though cyberbullying laws establish a framework for punishing those who use the internet to harass others those laws probably do little to deter such behaviour.

Others say it will take a combination of the law parent involvement and raising awareness to curb cyberbullying.

Parry Aftab a lawyer and executive director of WiredSafety.org which Megan's mother Tina Meier has joined to raise awareness of cyberbullying says Drew's conviction will have a dramatic effect on cyberstalking cases nationwide.

""Because of Megan's case people are paying attention"" Aftab said. ""The laws will make a difference once people understand that there are laws and once prosecutors start using them. We need to teach [people] that what you do online matters as much as what you do in real life because the internet is real life now.""

Justin Patchin a criminologist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and co-author of Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard is sceptical that such laws will be upheld in courts. He said the laws fail to deter such behaviour by young people because most don't understand what cyberbullying is. However Patchin said the laws may be more effective in protecting children targeted by adults.

""The vast majority of these cases can and should be dealt with informally in schools with parents"" Patchin said. ""Once we start criminalising minor forms of bullying and cyberbullying that's really going to draw too many kids into the criminal justice system.""

The federal case against Drew has brought national attention to cyberbullying spurring the creation of local and state laws that may encourage parents to better educate their children about the dangers said Thomas Holt a criminologist with the University of North Carolina-Charlotte.

But youngsters will continue to hurt each other online without thinking about the consequences. ""It's very hard to say that any 14-year-old with a cell phone who can text is going to think about a cyberbullying law when they're communicating with peers"" he said."
_HARMFUL_TRTH,Jan_12_2016_Stephen_Leather_accused_of_cyberbullying_by_fellow_thriller_writers.txt,"The bestselling thriller writer Stephen Leather has been accused of “smearing” and “cyberbullying” two fellow authors in a lengthy online campaign described as “despicable” by one of its alleged victims.

Over the past week the authors Steve Mosby and Jeremy Duns have each alleged that Leather is behind websites set up to attack them. On 4 January Mosby blogged about the launch of the site fuckstevemosby.com which featured an exhaustive collection of the times he swore online. Mosby claims that the site was set up by Leather. Duns the author of the Paul Dark spy novels then blogged a lengthy analysis of the reasons why he believes Leather is behind a series of sites abusing him – including the claim that the recently established site fuckjeremyduns.com briefly redirected to Leather’s own site about his character Spider Shepherd.

Duns accuses Leather of running a campaign against him since 2012 when Duns publicly endorsed a campaign against “sockpuppeting” – the practice of promoting one’s own books online under fake identities. At the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival that year Leather admitted to creating multiple online profiles telling the audience: “I’ll go on to several forums the well-known forums and post there under my name and under various other names and various other characters.” Duns writes: “I asked Leather on Twitter how he justified deceiving people into buying his books on the say-so of comments they had believed were from genuine fans of his – rather than simply from himself in disguise. In response Leather quickly blocked me and became personally insulting.”

Duns later interviewed the crime writer Steve Roach about Leather’s online behaviour after Roach made less than positive remarks about one of Leather’s books. When Nick Cohen wrote about the Roach story in the Observer Leather complained to the Press Complaints Commission but his complaint was dismissed.

The anonymous sites set up to attack Duns are intended Duns writes on his blog “to simply sling as much mud my way as possible and hope that something sticks and to make it so that if anyone Googles me – readers potential readers publishers producers etc – they might be influenced by the fact that apparently lots of people hate me and I am a Terrible Person Who Has Done Lots of Terrible Things ... The fact that the accusations are false and in most cases fairly obviously so doesn’t matter much as there is nothing I can do to take them down (I’ve tried).”

However Mosby’s discovery that the fuckjeremyduns.com site redirected to one of Leather’s own websites Duns writes means that Leather has “left a trail leading right back to his door”.

“It doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to figure out what happened here. Stephen Leather set up the site fuckjeremyduns.com to smear me but by mistake he included a redirect to another of his websites spidershepherd.com about his series character Dan ‘Spider’ Shepherd. He quickly realized the goof and so deleted the site he had planned to smear me with meaning it reverted to the registration page. But Steve Mosby got that screenshot first when it still redirected” writes Duns.

“In 2012 I helped bring wider attention to Leather’s sockpuppeting and cyber-bullying. Four years later Stephen Leather is attacking me and a writer he even shares a publisher with ... by sockpuppeting and cyberbullying. I think his behaviour is not just grossly unprofessional but pathetic and really pretty despicable. I can only hope that either his publisher or someone else intervenes to try to persuade him to stop it.

Duns’s blog has received the support of authors including JK Rowling who along with Leather is published by Hachette. “A very disturbing read about a fellow @HachetteUK author” tweeted Rowling. “If true this is shameful behaviour.”

— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) By @jeremyduns: a very disturbing read about a fellow @HachetteUK author. If true this is shameful behaviour https://t.co/QJsvtN5oIE

Leather did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian but the publisher Hachette said it has “advised him not to say anything to anyone at the moment”. In a statement Hachette said it would “do everything we can to put an end to this very unpleasant matter immediately” and that it “wholeheartedly condemns harassment and intimidation of any kind.”

Duns speaking on 12 January told the Guardian: “I try not to let it get to me but it is pretty frustrating.” “[Leather’s] idea has been to set up not just one website but several so that anyone who Googles me will see all these websites about how horrible I am” he said. “I’ve done my best to ignore them but they do have an effect on my reputation so when I realised he’d tripped up in this way I decided it was time to tackle it head-on. At this point I just want him to go away.”

Mosby said he had expected “very little reply” in response to his blog naming Leather but that “the reaction since has been incredibly supportive”.

“It’s reassuring not least because the more attention is paid the greater the chance he’ll decide to stop behaving in this manner” said Mosby. “Hopefully he’ll realise soon that by attacking and smearing other authors he’s only making himself look bad – and ultimately doing himself far more damage than them.”"
_PP,Feb__6_2012_Austrian_Law_Student_Faces_Down_Facebook.txt,"Both elements have the potential to hamper the data-harvesting engine that is at the heart of Facebook’s advertising-driven business and of its value.

Facebook said in a statement that its data practices followed European law and that the company had gone out of its way to meet Mr. Schrems’s request for personal information. The company also noted that Facebook users could easily obtain a copy of their information on Facebook by using a function within their personal account settings.

The company said a report in December from an Irish regulator demonstrated “how Facebook adheres to European data protection principles and complies with Irish law.” It says it is not only fully compliant with E.U. data protection laws but “we also strongly believe that every Facebook user owns his or her own data and should have simple and easy access to it.”

Mr. Schrems appeared on Facebook’s radar last June when he filed a complaint against the company with the Irish regulator the office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in Port Arlington Ireland. He alleged 22 violations of European law. Mr. Schrems filed the grievance after using a provision of Irish law to obtain from Facebook a copy of all of the information the company had been keeping on him.

Facebook sent Mr. Schrems a computer disc containing 1222 pages of information.

The disc Mr. Schrems said showed that Facebook was routinely collecting data that he had never consented to give like his physical location which he assumes was determined from his computer’s unique address identifiers which can be traced geographically. Facebook was also retaining data he had deleted Mr. Schrems said.

Irish officials began an audit based on his complaints and in October visited Facebook’s offices in the Hanover Quay section of Dublin where the company employs more than 400 workers to direct many of its global operations outside North America.

On Dec. 21 the Irish regulator which has a staff of only 22 employees released a 150-page report that gave Facebook until July to make a series of changes in the way it collects and retains data and how it explains to users how their information is being used.

Mr. Schrems during an interview last week said the Irish inquiry and the regulator’s agreement with Facebook had not addressed “90 percent” of his complaints. Mr. Schrems said he planned to request a “formal decision” from Irish officials which would give him the legal basis to challenge the regulator’s findings in Irish court.

Gary Davis the deputy Irish data commissioner who led the audit on Facebook said his agency had obtained significant concessions from Facebook that had had positive effects for the 854 million active global users of the site. After 40000 people requested their own data from Facebook Ireland the company responded Mr. Davis said by creating a software tool in October on the Web site that gives all users a quick overview of the data being kept on file.

Facebook announced improvements to that tool last week Mr. Davis said to provide more detailed information and has committed to providing even more by July when the regulator will revisit Facebook’s offices to check whether it has honored its commitments.

That visit could coincide with Facebook’s I.P.O. which could take place as early as May depending on the length of the regulatory review in the United States.

Mr. Davis said that Facebook as a result of Mr. Schrems’s campaign had agreed to cut the amount of time it retains data on most user activities on the Web site to less than one year. Queries typed into Facebook’s search field are deleted within six months in conformance with European law. Previously Mr. Davis said the company had no comprehensive policy on data retention with times often dictated by the perceived level of security threats and cyberattacks on the business.

“We still view Max very favorably for the issues he has raised which were very specific and well prepared and have led to concrete improvements in how Facebook does business” Mr. Davis said. “I obviously think we have achieved a lot in Ireland by getting Facebook to improve its transparency and data protection practices.”

Mr. Schrems said the concessions from Facebook had been insufficient. At the time of its release Thilo Weichert the data protection commissioner in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein criticized the Irish regulator saying it had identified infractions in Facebook’s handling of consumer data but had not taken a harder line or imposed financial penalties.

The main issue Mr. Schrems said is that no one including the Irish regulator is independently verifying whether Facebook is doing what it says it will do in terms of permanently deleting personal information and shortening data retention times.

“No one is actually looking into the computers” Mr. Schrems said. “The regulators are just getting statements from different parties and deciding based on a vacuum.”

Mr. Davis the Irish regulator said Facebook had given him full access to the data it kept."

_PP,Mar_21_2014_Microsoft_Software_Leak_Inquiry_Raises_Privacy_Issues.txt,"SEATTLE — Technology companies have spent months denying they know anything about broad government spying on people who use their Internet services.

But a legal case filed this week against a former Microsoft employee shows the power these companies themselves have to snoop on their customers whenever they want to.

Microsoft accused the former employee of stealing company trade secrets in the form of software code for the Windows operating system and leaking the software to a blogger. In an investigation the company figured out who revealed the information by reading the emails and instant messages of the blogger on his Microsoft-operated Hotmail and message accounts.

While Microsoft’s actions appear to have been legal and within the scope of its own policies its reading of the private online accounts of a customer without a court order was highly unusual and raises questions about its protections for customer data privacy lawyers say.

“What blogger will use that service now?” said Jennifer Granick an attorney and director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.

Ms. Granick said it appeared that Microsoft’s actions were within the boundaries of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which allows service providers to read and disclose customers’ communications if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of the service provider. Still she called the move by Microsoft “stupid” and said it should raise concerns among bloggers and journalists about using Microsoft Internet services to communicate with their sources.

Microsoft said it had done nothing wrong but seemed to acknowledge the unusual nature of its actions — as well as a brewing outcry over its methods of investigating the former employee — by saying it would take several new steps to reassure customers that their communications will be private.

In a statement John E. Frank a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel said that in the future if the company had evidence of a crime against Microsoft it would submit that evidence to an outside lawyer who is a former judge and that it would conduct a search of private communications only if the judge concluded there was enough evidence to meet the standards for a court order. Companies do not need to obtain court orders to search their own services Mr. Frank said.

He said the company would also state the number of searches of customer accounts that it conducted itself as part of a broader transparent report it publishes periodically on government and court orders.

“The privacy of our customers is incredibly important to us and while we believe our actions in this particular case were appropriate given the specific circumstances we want to be clear about how we will handle similar situations going forward” Mr. Frank said.

Criticism of Microsoft began mounting on Thursday after a report on a news site Seattlepi.com about the case. The details were especially troubling for people who saw potential implications for journalists.

“I have never seen a case like this” said Edward Wasserman the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at University of California Berkeley. “Microsoft essentially decided that whatever privacy expectation that its own customers supposedly had was basically a dead letter. It simply decided that in its own corporate interest it can intrude on a person’s email.”

In the case filed in federal court earlier this week in Seattle Microsoft accused Alex Kibkalo the former employee of leaking the Windows code to a French blogger in 2012. As part of an internal Microsoft investigation at the time Microsoft examined the blogger’s private Microsoft email and instant messaging accounts and discovered evidence that the blogger had received confidential information and Windows software code from Mr. Kibkalo who worked as a software architect for Microsoft in Lebanon.

The blogger is not identified in the complaint but the person is described as specializing in publishing leaked screenshots and other information about Microsoft products on the web. Much of the details in the complaint which was filed by an agent for the F.B.I. were based on Microsoft’s own inquiry.

Mr. Kibkalo a Russian national was arrested in Seattle this week. Russell Leonard a public defender assigned to represent him did not respond to requests for comment.

The picture that Microsoft’s investigation of the blogger paints is not a flattering one.

The complaint says a Microsoft investigative team interviewed the blogger during which the person admitted to receiving confidential information and software from Mr. Kibkalo. The blogger also admitted to selling activation keys for Windows Server software on eBay the complaint said.

Microsoft reached a confidentiality agreement with the blogger which is why he is not identified in the complaint according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Nate Cardozo a staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation a privacy rights group said that a number of companies had broad terms of service but that it was extremely rare that any actually follow through and sift through a customer’s personal email.

“To see Microsoft using this right to essentially look through a blogger’s email account for evidence of wrongdoing and then turn it over on a silver platter for law enforcement it is extremely undesirable” Mr. Cardozo said."

_PP,Jan_27_2012_Google_seeks_to_clarify_new_privacy_policy.txt,"Story highlights Google seeks to clarify its new privacy plan after backlash

Changes will create a user profile based on what users do on all Google products

Members of Congress have asked for clarification

Google notes there are privacy tools in place to opt out of some aspects

Seeking to blunt a sharp backlash to recent privacy policy changes Google has offered to share ""the real story"" about a system that compiles information about users based on their activity on all of Google's sites and products.

This week Google announced new privacy settings. They spell out the fact that the company collects and compiles data about its users based on their activity on its various sites -- from its search page to Gmail to YouTube to phones running its Android operating system.

The announcement gave some privacy advocates cause for alarm even though Google says the information is assembled to enhance user experience such as better targeting ads that will be of interest to its customers.

Perhaps most notably eight members of Congress both Democrats and Republicans wrote a letter to Google CEO Larry Page asking for clarification about the changes.

""While Google suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated"" reads the letter. The lawmakers also noted that because of Google's global reach the change ""potentially touches billions of people worldwide.""

It asks Google to share what kind of data it currently collects and explain how information collected under the newly announced system will be used.

In a post on the company's public policy blog Google's Betsy Masiello wrote that there have been misconceptions about the changes.

""A lot has been said about our new privacy policy"" she wrote. ""Some have praised us for making our privacy policy easier to understand. Others have asked questions including members of Congress and that's understandable too.""

Among the points that Masiello makes in the post:

_ Users don't have to be logged in to use many of Google's products including search and YouTube. No data is collected when a user is not logged in.

_ When logged in users can edit or turn off their search histories switch Gmail chat to ""off the record"" use ""incognito mode"" on the Google Chrome browser or employ other of Google's privacy tools.

_ Quite simply Web users don't have to use all of Google's products.

She noted that Google won't be collecting any more data about users than it was before.

""We're making things simpler and we're trying to be upfront about it. Period"" she wrote.

Not everyone was convinced.

While noting that there are some advantages to having your information stored in one place Brent Rose wrote for tech site Gizmodo that there are some scary aspects to it as well.

""There are certainly reasons to be concerned about keeping all of your eggs in one basket. It means there's a single point of failure which makes me nervous"" Rose wrote. ""The fact that you can't opt-out of shared search data and that Google will know more about you than your wife? That's a little creepy."""
_PP,Oct_19_2010_Facebook_Vows_to_Fix_a_Flaw_in_Data_Protection.txt,"SAN FRANCISCO — When you sign up for Facebook you enter into a bargain. You share personal information with the site and Facebook agrees to obey your wishes when it comes to who can see what you post.

At the same time you agree that Facebook can use that data to decide what ads to show you.

It is a complicated deal that many people enter into without perhaps fully understanding what will happen to their information. It also involves some trust — which is why any hint that Facebook may not be holding up its end of the bargain is sure to kick up plenty of controversy.

The latest challenge to that trust came on Monday when Facebook acknowledged that some applications on its site including the popular game FarmVille had improperly shared identifying information about users and in some cases their friends with advertisers and Web tracking companies. The company said it was talking to application developers about how they handled personal information and was looking at ways to prevent this from happening again.

Facebook’s acknowledgment came in response to an article in The Wall Street Journal that said several popular applications were passing a piece of data known as a user ID to outside companies in violation of Facebook’s privacy policy.

Having a user ID allows someone to look up that user’s name and any data posted on that person’s public profile like a college or favorite movies but not information that the user had set to be visible only to friends.

Privacy advocates and technology experts were split on the significance of the issue.

“That is extremely serious” said Peter Eckersley a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation an online liberties group.

Mr. Eckersley said advertisers could use the user IDs to link individuals with information they had collected anonymously about them on the Web. “Facebook perhaps inadvertently is leaking the magic key to tracking you online” he said.

At the same time Mr. Eckersley said there was no evidence that anyone who had access to this data had actually misused it.

Zynga the maker of FarmVille and other games on Facebook that have a combined 219 million users did not respond to requests for comment.

Several technology pundits and bloggers minimized the issue with some saying that credit card companies and magazines have access to far more detailed information about customers than any Facebook application.

Facebook also sought to play down the importance of the leak saying the sending of user IDs appeared to have been inadvertent. “Press reports have exaggerated the implications of sharing” a user ID Mike Vernal a Facebook engineer wrote on a company blog for application developers. “Knowledge of a UID does not enable anyone to access private user information without explicit user consent.”

In a statement Facebook said that while it would be a challenge to do so it planned to introduce “new technical systems that will dramatically limit the sharing of user IDs” and would continue to enforce its policies on outside applications shutting them down when necessary. It added that the companies that had received the user IDs said they had not made use of them.

Regardless the problem underscores another challenge facing the company: Facebook has grown so rapidly in both users and in technical complexity that it finds it increasingly difficult to control everything that happens on its site. In addition to more than 500 million Facebook users there are more than one million third-party applications running on the site.

The latest information leak was made possible by a quirk in a long-established technical standard used by Web browsers. The standard allows Web sites to record the address of the page a user clicked on to arrive there a bit of information known as a referrer.

Facebook has been including user IDs in these referrers for some time and last year technology experts pointed out that user IDs had leaked to advertisers that way. Facebook fixed that this year but apparently never addressed the problem when it came to referrers used by applications on its site.

“Facebook isn’t benefiting from it and Facebook is not intentionally leaking this data” said Christopher Soghoian a privacy advocate and research fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. “But it is not a trivial thing to re-engineer their systems.”

This year he filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming Google was leaking personal information because search terms appeared in its referrers.

The latest issue may have had particular resonance with Facebook users because the company has been reeling from a series of privacy controversies in part because it has been subtly pushing users to share data more publicly.

This year for example many users complained when Facebook changed the way in which users expressed preferences for certain movies or bands essentially making it more difficult to keep that information private.

And in May after a series of complaints from some users and privacy advocates the company made wholesale changes to its privacy settings.

Mark Zuckerberg the company’s chief executive apologized to users saying the settings were often too complicated for people to understand. Despite the changes the privacy issue has continued to dog Facebook.

“This is one more straw on the camel’s back that suggests that Facebook needs to think holistically not just about its privacy policies but also about baking privacy into their technical design” said Deirdre Mulligan a privacy expert and professor at the School of Information at the University of California Berkeley."
_PP,Nov__3_2015_How_a_digital_rights_project_ranks_tech_firms_and_attempts_to_fix_global_failure.txt,"No one reads those interminable terms of service agreements on Instagram WhatsApp and their like. But they could make the difference between life and death according to Rebecca MacKinnon.

“It may be about whether you get tortured for what you wrote on Facebook or not or whether you get tried based on some of the stuff you had in your text messages or something you uploaded. They’re worth a lot to human beings” said MacKinnon the leader of a new project that hopes to show people just what they are signing away when they blindly click “agree”.

Related: World's biggest tech companies get failing grade on data-privacy rights

MacKinnon’s project at the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute (a thinktank inside a thinktank) is called Ranking Digital Rights (RDR) which is also what it does. It scratches an itch most people probably feel nagging at them whenever they tick the little box under the login fields as they sign into a social network or a multiplayer online game: what am I agreeing to? What am I giving away? Who are these people?

We live in a world of options. Across that world people make choices about what technologies to use: Google Microsoft or Yahoo for email Vodafone or Orange for cellular AT&T America Movil or Axiata for internet service. Those decisions are often made on cost storage available ease of use or familiarity. Rarely do we care about the terms on which we’re using those technologies – until something goes wrong.

Your rights around your own information are too often ignored said MacKinnon and her team. With large-scale data theft in the news nearly every day consumers are starting to realize that it’s vital to understand how businesses agree to treat that data. Corporate disclosure notices and user agreements are written for regulators and tech lawyers. How can normal people make informed choices?

RDR is dedicated to answering that question. The project produced in concert with research firm Sustainalytics after detailed study of many many data handling standards from United Nations reports to Wharton’s Zicklin Accountability Index defines the borders of public corporate contracts on the internet. What happens legally when you pass information through Facebook? Or Gmail? Or Twitter? Or Tumblr? Governments across the globe are creating secret pipelines through which those companies may share your information with them – the US’s Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (Cisa) is only the most recent – and they share data with each other and with advertisers as well. MacKinnon wants to know how much you’re being told about your data’s disposition and by whom.

On a hot day in September in a little Washington DC office she was listening to a conversation about which technology company had performed best on her group’s index of fundamental rights – a series of privacy human rights and free speech indicators. Google had scored highest but Twitter seemed to have greater corporate commitment while disdaining the details.

Finally MacKinnon cut in: “If this was a test nearly everyone failed.”

Toward a digital bill of rights



There are plenty of jokes about terms of service. South Park had a whole episode devoted to how heedlessly we agree to them called Human CentiPad. But as MacKinnon points out they are incredibly serious when tested legally – as they are at the moment in the current courtroom face-off between Microsoft and the Department of Justice that could give the US government access to email stored anywhere in the world.

Nate Cardozo a staff attorney with the privacy rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation said that while it’s more common to hear about users getting the short end of the stick from the tech companies they patronize digital rights cut both ways.

“The terms of service are definitely enforceable in the United States under straight-up contract law” Cardozo said. “Any sophisticated company will draft its terms of service in order to give itself as much protection as possible and the user as little as possible. That’s just good lawyering.”



But there are cases where companies didn’t lawyer hard enough and they paid for it in court. He points to the court case that ensued from Facebook’s use of Beacon an advertising network that published details of people’s activities on other websites.

It ended in a lawsuit Lane v Facebook and an embarrassing climbdown for Facebook. “It was a class action against Facebook for essentially violating their privacy policy” Cordozo said.

If censorship and privacy are simply left to corporate discretion the results can be devastating. Yahoo settled out of court in 2007 after a human rights group sued the company for outing a Chinese dissident who was subsequently tortured; it was only one of several cases of alleged cooperation with local authorities. AT&T made domestic spying possible – and easy – over decades of collaboration with the National Security Agency (NSA) a partnership revealed by Edward Snowden.

MacKinnon wants to see users protected by commitments to generally agreed-upon universal digital rights. But there are impediments to that progress and they aren’t all simple self-interest: legal obligations prevent tech companies from disclosing vital information. Last year Twitter sued the US government for permission to disclose how often it had received “national security letters” and orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) that are part of a secret parallel courts system beyond the reach of the public.



The companies investigated by the index scored universally low on one important privacy metric: how well they inform consumers whether their information has been turned over to a government. Many are trying – Facebook among others produces an annual report of government requests and lists the reasons it is asked to censor its users. In Germany Holocaust denial is illegal; in Turkey defamation of Ataturk is illegal. But the law often makes it difficult.



Often in fact disclosures and notices and agreements tend to obscure how little we know about where and how our information is used by social media email and internet providers.



“No company clearly explains whether users can control what the company itself collects and shares about users” wrote the team in its executive summary. “Furthermore half of the companies do not explain whether users can access the information the company holds on them and seven companies do not provide detail on how long they hold user information.” This is becoming increasingly important – when Ashley Madison was hacked earlier this year it was revealed to have kept every single user profile from the beginning of its existence. The result was mass blackmail.



Even more egregiously no one at all will tell you what kind of content they censor not as a result of copyright notices or government requests but as a matter of course. Or why.

The post-Snowden world

MacKinnon is trying to make sure consumers know at least a little about the vital information created by and about them. Formerly the head of CNN’s Beijing bureau (and then Tokyo) she’s is an acknowledged expert in this widening field. In one of her books Consent of the Networked MacKinnon argued that the arc of technological history could bend away from justice if we let it.



“Governments and corporations are working actively to shape the internet to fit their own needs” she told the Atlantic when the book came out. “The most insidious situations arise when both government and corporations combine their efforts to exercise power over the same people at the same time in largely unconstrained and unaccountable ways.”



It’s in the best interests of these companies to make their protections clear to users said MacKinnon. “Particularly post-Snowden [a phrase Cardozo also uses] but even before that in some cases some of these companies were starting to realize that if they made incredible effort to show they cared about user rights it would be good for their business” she said. “We saw that with Google and some of things they didn’t end up doing in China [on privacy concerns]. Yahoo got burned pretty badly in China when they handed over user information to the police and then they signed on to the Network Initiative.



“Demonstrating that you’re taking users’ rights seriously is important to your business.”



If you’re unclear on what kinds of rights are afforded to you in writing by big public companies MacKinnon and her team say that probably simply puts you in the majority – this information is designed for regulators and lawyers not the consumers it ostensibly protects. Disclosure about data collection use sharing and retention is poor she said. Even if the information is publicly available it’s far away from the end-user.



“People used to be more worried about censorship than privacy” she said. “Then the pendulum swung the other way and they began to worry about privacy more which was good at the time. But it probably needs to swing back towards censorship again.”



Part of this is simply the acknowledgement of a very uncomfortable truth: As technology companies cross borders and develop new ways of transmitting and accessing vast quantities of information they behave more and more like governments with their own sets of rights and rules. What passes muster in the People’s Republic of Tumblr may not fly in Instagramistan. It might not even fly in the United States of Facebook which owns Instagram but keeps its user policies completely separate.



Tech companies are making an effort said MacKinnon pointing to Brad Smith Microsoft’s top lawyer calling the NSA “an advanced persistent threat to their business” and Apple’s Tim Cook championing encryption against the FBI’s wishes.

But this is an industry that wants more and more of your data. “Companies have business models where they collect and sell user information as part of the business – how do companies ensure that they’re being accountable to their users for what they’re doing?”

Technology companies have spent months denying they know anything about broad government spying on people who use their Internet services.

But a case filed this week against a former Microsoft employee shows the power these companies themselves have to snoop on their customers whenever they want to Nick Wingfield and Nick Bilton report.

Microsoft accused the former employee of stealing company trade secrets in the form of software code for the Windows operating system and leaking the software to a blogger. In an investigation the company figured out who revealed the information by reading the emails and instant messages of the blogger on his Microsoft-operated Hotmail and message accounts.

While Microsoft’s actions appear to have been legal and within the scope of its own policies its reading of the private online accounts of a customer without a court order was highly unusual and raises questions about its protections for customer data privacy lawyers say. Read more »"
_PP,Jul_28_2016_Meet_the_Brave_Souls_Who_Read_LinkNYC’s_Two_Different_Privacy_Policies.txt,"LinkNYC has been replacing all of New York’s public payphones with advertising emblazoned wifi kiosks. Residents and visitors curious about what those kiosks will do with data their routers cameras and Bluetooth beacons collect about them might look on its website for some kind of privacy policy. There is one there but it’s not that one. Columbia professor Benjamin Dean got a big laugh at this weekend’s HOPE XI conference in Manhattan when he pointed out that the privacy policy on LinkNYC’s website only applies to the website itself not to the actual network of kiosks.

It’s not quite as bad as it sounds. In LinkNYC’s defense the page in question points out the difference between the two policies up top but given the cursory way most people read online it wouldn’t be surprising if many users initially missed it (I did). Meanwhile it’s encouraging that Dean and his co-panelist New York Civil Liberties Union attorney Mariko Hirose actually did read those two privacy policies and that a room full of people showed up to hear what they found.

Tech privacy policies in general have been constructed primarily to guard companies against liability and discourage users from reading closely. This is unfortunate. They could be standardized and easy to understand. That said Dean and Hirose’s workshop this weekend showed the internet’s power of crowdsourced self-defense.

In a way it countered a working paper by communications professors Jonathan Obar and Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch which received attention last week for showing that out of a group of 543 college students asked to check out a new website only 11 noticed that when they signed up they agreed to terms that gave its operators rights to the users’ first born children.

Coverage of the paper focused on the fact that so few users even looked at the papers but what surprised me was that anyone looked at all. In other words there’s a Dean or a Hirose in any group.

“I don’t think the answer is to find a way to have everyone read every privacy policy. This as I note in the paper above is an ‘unattainable ideal.'” Obar wrote the Observer in an email. “So efforts to standardize language even simplify language even in accordance with American law aimed at making policies easier to understand continue to fail.”

To a degree it doesn’t matter if everyone checks everything. Terms of service apply to lots of people at once. If one person looks them and sees something disturbing he or she can put out the word. If it’s bad enough the internet will respond.

That’s what’s powerful about this weekend’s workshop: Dean and Hirose told a roomful of people what they found. Those people chattered about it on Twitter and then a reporter at Inverse wrote a detailed story breaking what they had to say down.

LinkNYC by the way is a product of Intersection which is owned by Sidewalk Labs which is owned by Alphabet (the company formerly known as Google). Google likes to link data about your behavior to your location. Your phone’s wi-fi antenna constantly broadcasts a map of your favorite places as artists dramatized with a multimedia installation next year. It wouldn’t be surprising if LinkNYC kiosks started recording which wifi access points the phones passing it are looking for.

As Hirose pointed out in the talk just because LinkNYC kiosks don’t use a sensor now doesn’t mean they won’t. “They essentially have a privacy policy that says ‘we can collect anything and do anything’ and that sets the outer bound” she said.

The policy does forbid the company from some activities. For example it promises not to use facial recognition which has become dramatically more powerful; however nothing stops the company from retracting that guarantee. In fact Hirose said that she’s been told by the company that the kiosk’s cameras haven’t even been turned on yet but it is also under no obligation to tell the public when the cameras go live.

And when users notice an objectionable change in policy: what can they do from there? If a website really did try to reserve rights to all members’ first born child the outcry of the internet would likely be enough to get the policy retracted (though the provision could also attract a niche audience for a company but only if it promised).

The trouble is here in America that’s really all we have to defend ourselves with: outrage. If it’s deafening it can be enough but if it doesn’t amount to more than a slow rumble tech companies will shrug it off with a bit of spin.

For example the NYCLU sent a letter to the city in March pushing for stronger language around data volume retention government use and sharing but the city—which has secured a substantial promised payday from Sidewalk Labs—has ignored it. There’s little more attorneys can do under current law. We have this outmoded idea called the “third party doctrine” that once someone uses a company’s service they give up all rights to privacy over whatever data that use generates.

For example I don’t really like Facebook but I keep it active because I want to get the invite if someone wants me to come to a party. Yet the fact that I want to get invitations leaves everything else I might have done on the site over the last 10 years up for grabs by the government and Facebook’s commercial partners. Of course I could quit the site but walking away from those invitations would impose a very high cost. Most people are unwilling to pay the price of giving up such networks which allows their owners to gradually ratchet up the rights they grant themselves under terms of service that we can’t negotiate unless we do it en masse.

It’s not that way everywhere. Last week French authorities called out Microsoft for releasing the Windows 10 operating system which turns personal computers into the sort of tattletales that smartphones have been all along. It’s one more way in which all Americans envy the French.

“Data privacy self-management is a fallacy under the current model” Obar wrote. “More needs to be done to involve users (automated systems infomediaries…) and ensure that the mosaic of Big Data approaches and threats can be properly monitored.”

Big tech companies find new ways to watch us every day. It’s reassuring at least to know that there are a few people out there watching back.

_PP,Jan_27_2012_Tech_Check:_Google's_privacy_policy_a_tablet_(and_e-reader)_revolution.txt,"(CNN) -- On this week's Tech Check podcast writers Doug Gross Stephanie Golberg and Mark Millian discuss Google's recent announcement of a new privacy policy -- and the concerns some folks have voiced about it.

The policy spells out the fact that Google is assembling users' activity on all of its products -- from search to Gmail to phones running its Android system on smartphones. Google says it's to enhance user experience (and better target ads) but some critics fear having all of that activity rounded up in one place.

We also talk about a pretty stunning number concerning tablets and e-readers. Both types of devices are at least a couple of years old. But according to a new survey the number of people who own them in the United States nearly doubled during just a few weeks in November and December.

Does this mean tablets and e-readers have reached a major tipping point?

Our Reader Comments of the Week come from a story about Facebook Timeline. The site said this week that the feature will no longer be optional.

And our Tech Fail of the Week goes to a politician who flung around some statistics about Apple and Steve Jobs this week. If only he'd thought to find out if they are actually true.

_PP,Aug_14_2016_The_IoT_threat_to_privacy.txt,"As the Internet of Things becomes more widespread consumers must demand better security and privacy protections that don’t leave them vulnerable to corporate surveillance and data breaches. But before consumers can demand change they must be informed — which requires companies to be more transparent.

The most dangerous part of IoT is that consumers are surrendering their privacy bit by bit without realizing it because they are unaware of what data is being collected and how it is being used. As mobile applications wearables and other Wi-Fi-connected consumer products replace “dumb” devices on the market consumers will not be able to buy products that don’t have the ability to track them. It is normal for consumers to upgrade their appliances and it most likely does not occur to them that those new devices will also be monitoring them.

After an Electronic Frontier Foundation activist tweeted about the unsettling similarity of the Samsung Smart TV privacy policy — which warned consumers not to discuss sensitive topics near the device — to a passage from George Orwell’s 1984 widespread criticism caused Samsung to edit its privacy policy and clarify the Smart TV’s data collection practices.

But most people do not read privacy policies for every device they buy or every app they download and even if they attempted to do so most would be written in legal language unintelligible to the average consumer. Those same devices also typically come with similarly unintelligible terms of use which include mandatory arbitration clauses forcing them to give up their right to be heard in court if they are harmed by the product. As a result the privacy of consumers can be compromised and they are left without any real remedy.

Increased corporate transparency is desperately needed and will be the foundation of any successful solution to increased privacy in the IoT. This transparency could be accomplished either by industry self-regulation or governmental regulation requiring companies to receive informed and meaningful consent from consumers before collecting data.

Consumers must demand to know what data is collected and how it is used.

Generally industries will respond if their customers demand more privacy. For example after surveys revealed that new-car buyers are concerned about the data privacy and security of connected cars the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (a trade association of 12 automotive manufacturers) responded by developing privacy principles they agreed to follow.

Businesses can self-regulate by developing and adopting industry-wide best practices on cybersecurity and data minimization. When companies collect user data they must take responsibility for protecting their users; if they do not want to be responsible for the data they should refrain from collecting it in the first place.

Some companies such as Fitbit embed privacy into their technology. The benefit of industry self-regulation is that each industry can create standards specific to the needs of their customers and the sensitivity of the data they collect.

Layered privacy policies should be a best practice adopted by many industries and Creative Commons licenses could serve as useful models. Those licenses have a three-layer design: the “legal code” layer the “human-readable” layer and the “machine-readable” layer.

The “legal code” layer would be the actual policy written by lawyers and interpreted by judges. The “human-readable” layer would be a concise and simplified summary of the privacy policy in plain language that an average consumer could read. The “machine-readable” layer would be the code that software search engines and other kinds of technology can understand and would only allow the technology to have access to information permitted by the consumer.

These best practices would make tremendous progress in protecting the privacy of consumers but they are not enough. Companies must be legally bound to the promises they make to their customers. The use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses in terms of use have become standard in many industries. These clauses deny consumers their right to pursue a remedy in a court of law usually without their knowledge because they are buried in indecipherable fine print.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has found that arbitration clauses’ bar on class actions further hurts the public interest because lawsuits often generate publicity about a corporate practice and without them consumers may not have access to that information. The agency has therefore proposed prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses for most consumer financial products and services.

The Department of Education has also proposed a rule that would prohibit the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements by for-profit schools giving students who have been exploited the right to sue their schools. The Federal Trade Commission should consider proposing a similar rule that would prohibit the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements by companies that sell IoT products.

Because this is such a complex problem involving countless industries and implicating various privacy concerns an adequate solution will require participation by consumers businesses and the government. Consumers must demand to know what data is collected and how it is used. Industries should develop best privacy practices that match their customers’ expectations.

The Federal Trade Commission should bring enforcement actions for deceptive practices against companies that do not comply with their own privacy policies holding them accountable to their customers. It should also consider prohibiting pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses so that consumers can have a cause of action when their privacy is violated.

But before this can happen consumers must demand to know what data is collected by their devices in the IoT.

_PP,Sep_18_2015_Facebook's_new_opt-out_for_tracking_ads_is_not_enough_says_privacy_expert.txt,"Facebook has rolled out a new tool that allows users to choose whether tracking data from ‘Like’ buttons and other social elements is used to serve them ads but privacy experts say the move does not go far enough.



The new privacy tool allows users to opt-out of behavioural advertising which uses tracking tools that monitor where users go and what they see on the web.

Facebook previously pointed users who wanted to opt out of behavioural advertising to third-party choice sites such as the Digital Advertising Alliance as well as opt-out mechanisms within its iOS and Android apps.

Stephen Deadman global deputy chief privacy officer for Facebook said: “We’re introducing an additional way for people to turn off this kind of advertising from the ad settings page right on Facebook. If you choose to use this tool it will become the master control for online interest-based advertising across all of your devices and browsers where you use Facebook.”

Brendan Van Alsenoy author of a Belgium data protection report into Facebook and a legal researcher at the KU Leuven Centre for IT & IP Law said: “This new setting is a very modest step in the right direction. But the net result for privacy is limited.”

The use of tracking information for behavioural ads is still an opt-out process rather than opt-in with explicit consent warned Van Alsenoy.

“The ‘new’ setting only determines whether or not Facebook will use its tracking data for ad purposes. Regardless of the setting Facebook will still collect the same information about your visits to external sites containing Facebook social plug-ins. Facebook only promises to no longer use this information for the purposes of interest-based advertising” Van Alsenoy added.

Privacy fight across Europe

A report commissioned by the Belgian data protection authority claimed that Facebook used long-term cookies to track users as well as non-users of Facebook when browsing the open web

 using its social plugins such as the Like button which is placed on 13m sites including health and government sites.

The social network disputed the claims saying that the report did not understand Facebook’s use of data.

The Belgian data protection authority later took Facebook to court over its alleged “trampling” over Belgian and European privacy law specifically around its lack of explicit consent from non-users for tracking. Initial arguments in the case are expected to be heard Monday.

This week Facebook began displaying cookie placement warnings to non-users who visit the social network at the behest of the Irish data protection authority which audits Facebook’s privacy practices. The site has been accused of preempting the opening arguments of the Belgian lawsuit.

Tracking and the use of behavioural data has been thrown into the spotlight first by privacy implications highlighted across Europe and now by the advent of content blockers within Apple’s latest iOS 9 operating system for iPhone and iPad.

The use of adblockers which prevent tracking code within websites and from third-parties from operating has risen dramatically on mobile platforms within the last two days.

On the desktop however “users concerned about Facebook tracking should continue to use tools such as Privacy Badger Ghostery or Disconnect” according to Van Alsenoy."
_PP,Jul_26_2013_Under_Code_Apps_Would_Disclose_Collection_of_Data.txt,"Like food packages that display nutrition labels some mobile apps could soon display information that allows consumers to decide at a glance whether the apps are good for them.

A variety of groups including app developers and consumer advocates have agreed to test a voluntary code of conduct that would require participating app developers to offer short-form notices about whether their apps collect certain personal details from users — including health and social networking data — or share user-specific data with entities like advertising networks or consumer data resellers.

The idea is to allow people to compare the data collection practices of say flashlight apps and choose one that does not ingest unrelated material like their photos or contact lists. The determination that the notices are ready for testing is the outcome of yearlong negotiations — convened by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration a division of the United States Commerce Department — to increase mobile app transparency for consumers. Participants included app developers digital marketing civil liberties consumer and privacy groups.

On Thursday many participants in the process voted to support a version of the code drafted by a diverse coalition including the Application Developers Alliance an industry association and advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the World Privacy Forum.

Although major mobile app developers like Apple and Google which develops mobile apps for its Android platform have not indicated whether they intend to sign on to the code of conduct groups involved in drafting it say it is a significant advance in mobile privacy for consumers — and an unusual agreement among industry and consumer advocates.

“It’s a victory for common sense” said Tim Sparapani vice president for law policy and government relations at the Application Developers Alliance a group representing more than 100 companies and 20000 individual developers.

But other participants in the negotiations said the notices would do little to give individual consumers more insight into or control over the vast piles of information about them that online entities collect and analyze. The notices would display only a limited list of data collection categories they say and would not allow consumers to opt out of data-mining or even see the records companies had amassed about them.

“A very modest slice of privacy was put forward” for the groups to tackle said Susan Grant the director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America a research and advocacy organization representing about 300 consumer groups. “As time went on that slice became more and more narrowed.”

She abstained from the vote Thursday on whether to support the code.

In the past the app industry has been heavily criticized by some federal regulators and consumer advocates for collecting personal details from users without their knowledge or consent. A review last year by the Federal Trade Commission of 400 popular children’s apps available on Google and Apple platforms concluded that only 20 percent disclosed their data collection practices.

The code of conduct would require participating mobile app developers to show notices indicating whether their apps collected user-specific details in any of eight categories: biometrics including fingerprints or facial recognition data; Web browsing history; logs of phone calls or texts made or received; contact list details like e-mail addresses or social network connections; financial information like credit or banking data; health or medical data; precise location data; and stored text video or photo files.

Signatories to the code would also have to list any of eight categories of entities with which their apps shared information; these include ad networks; mobile carriers; consumer data resellers; data analytics companies; government entities; operating systems; social networks; or other apps.

Companies that violated a promise to adhere to the code would be subject to enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission. The code is the first step in a larger plan by the Obama administration to institute a wide-ranging consumer privacy bill of rights that would give consumers some rights to access control and correct the personal details companies collected about them.

Last year the White House issued a report proposing that Congress enact such a consumer privacy bill. The report said the bill would rely on codes of conduct worked out in industry-advocacy group negotiations to specify how different industries would adhere to those principles. The administration has yet to make public the proposed text for the legislation.

But some participants who helped develop the mobile app transparency notices said the modest gains that resulted for consumers indicated a need for stronger privacy legislation and regulation.

_PP,Mar_22_2012_Facebook_strips_'privacy'_from_'data_use'_policy_explainer.txt,"A protest outside Facebook's headquarters in 2010 drew attention to its controversial privacy policies.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A Facebook data policy document intended to make the site's methods more transparent is instead kicking up a fresh firestorm.

Facebook made a significant but little-noticed change to its privacy policy on Sept. 23 wiping out the word ""privacy"" and rebranding it as a ""data use"" policy. Late last week Facebook posted a draft version of its ""Statement of Rights and Responsibilities"" governance document -- an explainer meant to guide users through Facebook's policies -- reflecting the changes. It gave users seven days to weigh in on the draft.









Facebook casts the revisions to its policy documents as a non-event. It says the actual changes to its privacy policy happened six months ago and that the current updates are simply intended to clarify them.

That clarity is freaking some members out. Many responded on Facebook's comment page with a wholesale rejection of the new terms. On the German-language version of the proposal more than 32000 Facebook members issued the same one-sentence protest: ""Ich lehne die Änderungen ab.""

That roughly translates to: ""I reject the changes.""

The provision drawing the most heat from commenters is a line describing what data applications can grab.

Facebook's current policy says: ""When you use an application your content and information is shared with the application."" Its proposed revision amends that line to: ""When you or others who can see your content and information use an application your content and information is shared with the application.""

The idea that apps your friends install can access your information disturbed many of Facebook's commenters. As one put it: ""Strongly disagree -- why should I be dragged into apps my friends are involved with?""

You already are. Facebook's current terms allow apps to tap into all of the information that the app's users have access to Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes told CNNMoney.

The policy revision is intended to make that reality clearer to Facebook's users he said. Those who want keep apps from sucking in their data can set granular controls on their ""privacy settings"" page on Facebook.

0:00 / 2:34 This app knows who your friends are

Facebook likes to emphasize the rule's benign intent. For example an app called Gogobot uses Facebook check-in data that your friends have shared with you to map out where those you know have been. The feature is intended to help you find savvy locals to tap for travel advice.

But the changes have some users edgy about just how widely their personal information can be shared -- and about Facebook's incentives to push those boundaries.

""This is a significant acknowledgement that Facebook is focused on data collection data storage and data sales because that's where they make their money"" says Sarah Downey a privacy analyst at security software company Abine. ""They're more accurately describing what they do.""

Some of Facebook's other changes to the policy -- which was last updated almost a year ago -- accommodate its new features. For example the word ""profile"" is now often replaced with ""Timeline"" Facebook's latest update to its profile pages.

The new statement also reflects the features Facebook has shut down. For example language referring to Facebook Deals has been deleted since Facebook scratched the deal program in August.

Another new provision makes it clear that Facebook can in its sole discretion disable some of its features for users in certain geographical areas. The change comes as Facebook and its social-networking peers grapple with heavy legal restrictions on their services in some countries.

Facebook hasn't set a date for when its revised policy will take effect. The company says it needs to sort through users' comments and concerns before finalizing the wording."

Microsoft Reworks Privacy Policy To Include Enterprise Products

Microsoft recently published a new set of privacy policies for organizations using Microsoft's enterprise products including online services and servers.

The new ""Enterprise Products"" section in Microsoft's privacy policy took effect on Aug. 2 according to an account by The Register. With regard to Microsoft's online services account administrators will get offers from Microsoft about ""other products and services"" under this policy. Account administrator contact information could get shared with Microsoft's partners. Microsoft may also send third-party nonpromotional communications to administrators per the online services policy:

We may also contact you regarding third-party inquiries we receive regarding use of the Online Services as described in your agreement. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these non-promotional communications.

On the server products side Microsoft's Enterprise Products privacy policy states that Microsoft mostly will collect ""usage data"" including server performance data as well as device data ""to learn about your operating environment to improve security features."" Microsoft also collects crash data if an organization opts to send it.

The Enterprise Products policy could conflict with an agreement between Microsoft and an organization. In such cases ""the terms of those agreement(s) will control"" the policy stated. However the policy adds that ""some Enterprise Products have their own separate privacy statements.""

And that's kind of an understatement. For instance Windows 10 features such as Cortana have their own separate privacy policy statements to review that will change over time. For instance in July Microsoft updated its Cortana privacy policy to describe ""data sharing with third-party services.""

The privacy policy also was updated in July to explain that Cortana can have access to user browsing history and that ""enabling that feature will allow us to collect your Microsoft Edge search queries and full browsing history associated with your user ID to personalize your experience.""

Another privacy policy update of note in July was a description of data transfers from European Union countries. Microsoft has been signaling its intent to back the current ""Privacy Shield"" legal framework for U.S. and EU data transfers. European agencies such as one in France have been proactive about addressing potential privacy issues.

The change history for Microsoft's privacy policies can be found at this page.

IT pros likely may not spend much time thinking about organizational privacy compliance issues. However now it's in writing and in several places to check if organizations are using Microsoft's enterprise products and services."
_PP,Oct_23_2012_Microsoft_Tightens_Personal_Data_Rules.txt,"Microsoft said on Monday that it would change its new disclosure policy to tell consumers explicitly that it would not use personal information it collects from users of some Microsoft products to produce or promote targeted online advertising.

The action followed a letter by Representative Edward J. Markey a Massachusetts Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Bipartisan Privacy Caucus to Steven A. Ballmer Microsoft’s chief executive expressing concern about the policy which went into effect on Friday.

In raising questions about Microsoft’s new policy Mr. Markey cited an Oct. 20 article in The New York Times which reported that the new Microsoft Services Agreement gave the company broad leeway to collect and use personal information gleaned from consumers of its free Web-based products like e-mail search and instant messaging.

The policy allowed Microsoft to use the personal data in targeted advertising although Microsoft pledged in its blog posts and e-mails to customers that it would not do so. The products affected by the Service Agreement include the company’s Web-based Hotmail and Outlook.com e-mail services but not the Outlook program that is bought and loaded directly onto a personal computer’s hard drive.

Microsoft said it wanted to make its intentions clear in light of the Times article and the letter from Mr. Markey. “One thing we don’t do is use the content of our customers’ private communications and documents to target advertising” Microsoft said in a statement released on Monday afternoon.

“We could have been clearer about this when we rolled out our updated Services Agreement” the statement said. “We appreciate the feedback we’ve received and as a result we will update the agreement as soon as possible to make that point absolutely clear.”

The Times article reported that privacy advocates were concerned about the new policy given that no single authority regulates the data-collection practices of Internet companies.

The Microsoft policy appeared to give the company the same rights as Google which scans the content of e-mails sent through its Gmail system focusing on keywords to generate advertising that it thinks will interest the user. Google attracted widespread criticism when it revised its privacy policy to allow it to share that information across its product lines.

In his letter to Microsoft Mr. Markey said he was “concerned about the privacy and security implications of Microsoft’s policy of aggregating information about consumers across a suite of Microsoft services stitching together detailed in-depth consumer profiles.”

He urged Microsoft to consider an opt-in standard that would allow the collection of personal information from users who specifically indicated that they wanted the company to collect that information.

Microsoft’s policy did not apply its Internet Explorer Web browser. But it has said that just such an opt-in standard known as a “do not track” option will be the default setting on the coming release of Internet Explorer 10 the latest version of the browser."
