Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, his rep confirms to Just Jared.

The 41-year-old actress and director filed for divorce on Monday (September 19), TMZ reports, citing irreconcilable differences from the 52-year-old actor. Sources say that Angelina‘s decision to divorce Brad had to do with the way he was parenting their six children.

TMZ also reports there was no “third person” involved in the split. Angelina wants physical custody of the children, and for Brad to have legal visitation. Brad and Angelina are parents to Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.

Angelina and Brad were last seen out together back in July, for their twins birthday celebration. They were also seen making a rare appearance together on July 4.

The couple married in August of 2014. The date of separation is listed as September 15, 2016.
