Angelina Jolie made a surprise appearance at a UN Peacekeeping conference.

The actress looked effortlessly chic in a black sheer dress as she attended the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial in London, England, on Thursday (Sept. 8, 2016). During her speech, she made it a point to shed light on women’s rights and how they should be placed at the “heart” of United Nations peacekeeping operations.

“We know that decades have been spent establishing conventions and resolutions enshrining rights and protection for women and vulnerable groups. But yet, if you are a woman in Syria, Somalia, the Central African Republic and any nation stricken by conflict, these are still shamefully empty promises,” the mom-of-six explained (via The Guardian).

“It has to be accompanied by a new way of conducting peacekeeping, one that has the rights and protection and involvement of women at its heart,” the mother-of-six, who has been actively involved with the UN since 2001, added.

Jolie is a mom, actress, and peacekeeper — is there anything she can’t do?
