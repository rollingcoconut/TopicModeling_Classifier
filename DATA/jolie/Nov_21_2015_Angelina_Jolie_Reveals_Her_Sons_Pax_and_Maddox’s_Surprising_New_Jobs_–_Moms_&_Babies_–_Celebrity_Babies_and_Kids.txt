Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt‘s children are getting an early start in the family business.

Their second oldest son, Pax, 11, has a job on the set of Jolie Pitt’s newest movie, First They Killed My Father.

“Pax is doing a lot of the stills,” Jolie Pitt, 40, tells PEOPLE in the magazine’s new issue. “The whole movie is from a child’s point of view.”

Directed and co-written by Jolie Pitt, First They Killed My Father is adapted from a memoir about by Loung Ung about the 1970s genocide in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge. Jolie-Pitt is filming the movie in Cambodia, where her oldest son Maddox is from.

Maddox, 14, is helping with research for First They Killed My Father. He also worked as a production assistant for Jolie Pitt’s most recent movie, By the Sea, her first onscreen collaboration with husband Pitt in 10 years.

“Every time we had a fight scene or sexual scene he obviously wouldn’t be near us. So he had to work in the parking lot,” Jolie Pitt, who wrote, directed and starred in the movie, says. “But he read the scenes of the day — I didn’t even know! One day he came up to me and said, ‘Really interesting script, Mom.’ ”

Jolie Pitt and Pitt, 51, have four other children: Zahara, 10, Shiloh, 9, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 7.
