Does Angelina Jolie have another baby on the way? Her latest tattoo seems to suggest that might be the case.

On a recent U.N. goodwill mission to the Tunisia-Libya border, the star was seen sporting fresh ink on her arm, a new map of coordinates just below the already tattooed coordinates of where each of her six children were born, reports People.

It is believed that the latest numbers relate to the region Jolie is currently visiting.

Though the skin art has led to speculation that the Oscar winner and her partner Brad Pitt are getting ready to welcome another child into their brood, an insider insists to People that the couple currently have no new plans to adopt.

Stay tuned.
