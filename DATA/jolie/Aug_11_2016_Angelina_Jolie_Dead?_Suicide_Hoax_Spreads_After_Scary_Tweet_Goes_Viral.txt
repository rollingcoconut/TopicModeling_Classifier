A horrifying rumor has spread that Angelina Jolie, mother of six, committed suicide and left a disturbing video behind for her loved ones — and now her fans are totally freaking out.

Wow, this is so scary. A random website called Entertainment News Update posted a shocking report that Angelina Jolie, 41, had taken her own life. This led fans into a total frenzy on social media, with many of them not believing that she was dead — which is good, because it was totally a hoax according to Snopes.

See how fans were reacting to the hoax on Twitter:

HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina’s rep for comment on the disturbing false report that she was dead. The report claimed to have footage from CNN of Angelina saying “goodbye” to her fans and her husband, Brad Pitt, 52. The caption on the report was even more upsetting as it read, “This is really sad, nobody deserves to die by suicide!! God will settle it all in the end, and only HE knew their heart!!! Rest in Paradise,Prayers for the family. Farewell JOLIE!”
