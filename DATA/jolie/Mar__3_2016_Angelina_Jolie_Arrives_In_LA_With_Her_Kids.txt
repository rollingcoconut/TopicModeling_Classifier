Welcome home! Angelina Jolie was spotted arriving at LAX with her kids Pax, Shiloh and Zahara on Wednesday March 2rd, 2016.

The actress, who was dressed in her signature head-to-toe black, walked hand and hand with her girls as they exited the terminal.

The family is returning home after 3 months in Cambodia where Angelina filmed her upcoming Netflix movie, First They Killed My Father.

They reportedly made a quick stop in London to visit dad Brad Pitt, who is busy filming(and producing) the sequel for World War Z.

The Jolie-Pitts are expected to live in London for the next 6 months while Brad works on his movie. The A-list couple is looking to buy a house in the Big Smoke, but haven’t had any luck finding one that suits their family’s needs.
