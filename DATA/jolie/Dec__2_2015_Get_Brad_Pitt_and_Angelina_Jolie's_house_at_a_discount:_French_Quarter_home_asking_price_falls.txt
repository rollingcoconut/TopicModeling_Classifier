Looking to live big for a little less dough? You can now score Brad Pitt's and Angelina Jolie's French Quarter home for a mere $5.65 million.

As Curbed.com reports, the asking price for the house, which once housed Cosimo Mattassa's recording studio, fell by $850,000.

The home first went on the market in May when the celebrity couple decided to "look for something more off the beaten path down the road," according to a statement emailed to NOLA.com at the time.

"In the meantime, they remain committed to, and infatuated as ever with the city of New Orleans, and will continue to focus on growth in the lower 9th through the Make It Right Foundation," the statement continued.

If you're in the market for a multimillion dollar French Quarter home, the Realtor.com listing for the Brangelina house notes it is an "exquisite, historic French Quarter masonry mansion (circa 1830)."

Amenities include "a very private, landscaped court yard complete with parterres a cocktail pool ... grand spiral staircase, Venetian plastered walls, marble mantles, gourmet kitchen, Spanish slate roof, elevator, fireplaces, separate 2-story guesthouse and parking for 2 cars."
