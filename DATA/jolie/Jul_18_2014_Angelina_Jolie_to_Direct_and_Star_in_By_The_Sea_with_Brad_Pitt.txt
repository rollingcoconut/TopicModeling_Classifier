Now that her second directorial effort, Unbroken, is in post-production and making its way towards a Christmas Day 2014 debut, Angelina Jolie is revving up to direct a brand new project, a film called By The Sea.

We’ve got zero story details on By The Sea at the moment, but it’s being described as a “character-driven drama” and apparently, it’s already in pre-production. Universal Pictures just snatched up the worldwide rights so perhaps Chairman Donna Langley and her team are pleased with what Jolie is doing at Universal with Unbroken. Hit the jump for more.
