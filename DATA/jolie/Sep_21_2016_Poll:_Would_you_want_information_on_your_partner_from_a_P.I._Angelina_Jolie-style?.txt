If you’re reaction to this headline is “I don’t care” or “who cares” then stop reading because another day, means another round of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt split news and that’s what we’ll be talking about on tomorrow’s Fly Morning Rush.

Dozens of media outlets are reporting Jolie hired a private investigator to check out Brad Pitt’s behaviors and actions when they weren’t together. The P.I. apparently watched Pitt on the set of his new film and found all sorts of salacious bits, including a supposed affair with Marion Cotillard.

If a private investigator offered to track your long-time partner, would you accept? Would finding out what he or she is doing when you’re not together be of interest or is there such a thing as too much information?
