Is Angelina Jolie dying? An alleged pal close to the actress says she’s on the verge of death as she “refuses to eat and has deteriorated to a mere 83 pounds.”

An insider dishes to the National Enquirer that the A-Lister’s situation is “so grave husband Brad Pitt and their six children fear she will be dead within a few years. Angie is driving herself to an early grave. She looks like a walking corpse.”

The tabloid even went as far as to claim Jolie “may still face a cancer battle” despite having gone through a double mastectomy in 2013. “Angie seems to be flirting with death,” the snitch spills, adding, “Friends worry that she could have as little as two years left to live,” and Angie’s kids are so worried that they “asked Brad if Mommy is going to die.”

There’s no denying Angelina Jolie is super thin, but is that enough evidence to claim the actress is knocking at death’s door? A source close to the star tells RumorFix there’s not a shred of truth to the story, and that Angelina is perfectly healthy at this time.
