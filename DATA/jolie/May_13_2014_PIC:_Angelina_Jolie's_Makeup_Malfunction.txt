Somebody should probably tell Angelina Jolie that sometimes less is more! The actress walked the red carpet with her fiance, Brad Pitt, for the premiere of his new TV movie The Normal Heart, but suffered a noticeable makeup malfunction amidst the bright lights.

The Oscar-winner kept it simple in her typical black ensemble, but went a little overboard on the powder, causing her face and chest to give off an obvious shine.

Brad is a producer on The Normal Heart, a new TV film about the rise of HIV/AIDS in New York in the early 1980s. The movie will air on HBO May 25.
