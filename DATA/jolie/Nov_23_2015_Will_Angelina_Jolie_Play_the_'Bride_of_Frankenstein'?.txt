Even though Fox is resurrecting Frankenstein this weekend with Victor Frankenstein, Universal Pictures is continuing forth with their own monsters revival, which includes modern/fresh takes on The Wolfman, The Mummy, Creature From the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein, and even Bride of Frankenstein.

The plans have been leaking out over the past year, but much of the details are still kept in the Mummy’s tomb.

THR, however, has sneakingly leaked some info on a story regarding Angelina Jolie Pitt‘s By the Sea, implying that the big time Hollywood star and producer could play the lead in Bride of Frankenstein.

But even if Universal loses tens of millions of dollars on ‘By the Sea,’ the studio is gambling that by backing Jolie Pitt’s artistic whim, she will be amenable to starring in its tentpole ‘Bride of Frankenstein’ from producer Brian Grazer.

When awful, awful passion projects get made by studios, there’s usually a reason, and trading off financing one in exchange for the same “name” actor to appear in another is regular business.

James Whale’s 1935 Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest genre films of all time, and to see Jolie as the character would actually be pretty damn exciting. I am curious as to whom is penning the script and who they’re looking at for director.

The Mummy is being filmed off a script by Jon Spaihts while Aaron Guzikowski is tackling The Wolfman. Ed Solomon and Noah Hawley are working on a film for the series but it’s unsure which monster they’re going to focus on. Apparently, Chris Morgan (the Fast and the Furious franchise) is also a part of the collective that is working on this reboot series, although he supposedly hasn’t been assigned any specific character to work on.
