Why did Angelina Jolie request sole physical custody of children from Brad Pitt?

TODAY legal analyst Lisa Bloom says parents typically share important decisions surrounding their children unless there is abuse or neglect, which is not alleged between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Bloom says Jolie has stated this split is about what's "in best interest for the children." She also says she would be shocked if a couple with "this level of earnings does not have a pre-nup."
