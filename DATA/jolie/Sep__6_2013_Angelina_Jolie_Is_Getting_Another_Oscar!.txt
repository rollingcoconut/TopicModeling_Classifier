It's only September, and Angelina Jolie has already won an Oscar!

No, it's not for Girl, Interrupted 2: The Amanda Bynes Story. It's not for acting at all.

Angelina is being presented with the honorary Governors Award. Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences President Cheryl Boone Isaacs says:

"The Governors Awards pay tribute to individuals who've made indelible contributions in their respective fields. We couldn't be more excited for this yearâ€™s honorees and look forward to bringing their peers and colleagues together to celebrate their extraordinary achievements."

Angelina certainly qualifies as indelible! In action films like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Wanted, and S.A.L.T., Angelina has been a peerless pioneer in putting women right in the middle of the mayhem. Plus, her humanitarian work has lead her to be apart of such important projects as In the Land of Blood and Honey, which she directed in 2011.

So who are this year's other honorees? The incomparable Angela Lansbury, costumer Piero Tosi, and funnyman Steve Martin.

That's some exclusive company! Congrats to all!
