Infidelity and poor parenting skills have been blamed for the demise of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt‘s two-year marriage. Now, a co-star of the couple is confirming Pitt’s drinking may have contributed to the shocking Hollywood divorce.

“They are curious, these American stars,” French actor Richard Bohringer told Closer of when he worked with the couple on the film By the Sea. “Brad Pitt, he lives on whiskey. She is a funny girl. They’re a funny couple.”

Although Jolie listed their separation date as September 15th on the divorce documents, Bohringer noticed there was “trouble brewing” as early as 2014.
