It was the split nobody in Hollywood saw coming.

On Tuesday morning, E! News confirmed that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from Brad Pitt after two years of marriage and more than a decade together.

"Angelina will always do what's in the best interest of taking care of her family," Angelina's longtime manager Geyer Kosinski said in an exclusive statement to E! News. "She appreciates everyone's understanding of their need for privacy at this time."

Brad would later break his silence in a separate statement. "I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well being of our kids," he shared with E! News. "I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time."

Still, many pop culture fans are left asking one big question: What went wrong between these two talented A-list stars?
