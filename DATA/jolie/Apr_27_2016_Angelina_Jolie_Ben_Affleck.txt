Angelina Jolie is NOT worried about Brad Pitt hanging out with Ben Affleck, despite a made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told there’s “no truth” to it.

Both Pitt and Affleck are currently living in London filming separate movies, and both actors have their families alongside them. According to OK!, the two plan on spending time together, which supposedly doesn’t sit well with Jolie. A so-called “source” tells the tabloid, “Brad in particular is excited to have someone to go drinking with, [but] Angie thinks Ben is a terrible influence.”

The magazine’s seemingly phony insider further claims, “Angie thinks Ben’s single status spells trouble. She doesn’t want Brad playing wingman, so he’ll be on a very short leash.” But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the situation, who exclusively assures us there’s “no truth” to the tabloid’s story. Here’s what’s really going on: Pitt and Affleck both happen to be shooting movies in London at the moment, and so the publication concocted a way to tie the two famous actors into a bogus report.

Of course, Gossip Cop is not the least bit surprised by the tabloid’s inaccurate article. We have repeatedly called out OK! for fabricating stories about everyone involved in this latest tall tale. Gossip Cop recently debunked the magazine’s claim that Pitt was moving into a bachelor pad in London behind his wife’s back. We also recently busted the outlet for falsely alleging Affleck was hooking up with Charlize Theron.
