The full story from The Enquirer:

ANGELINA JOLIE is eating like a bird – literally! Sources say the already scrawny actress has become hooked on foods prepared with “ancient grains” that only a parakeet could love.

“Angie’s always been a fan of healthy seeds and grains, but lately she’s taken it to a whole new level,” said an insider.

“She’s into eating products made with ‘ancient grains’ and raves about their health benefits. She claims they provide her with nutrients she can’t find anywhere else, plus shinier skin. But the problem is that she’s not balancing her diet with fruits, meats or vegetables.” “Ancient grains” – such as millet, chia seeds, spelt, buckwheat and quinoa – are truer to their original roots than grains like wheat and rice, which have been bred selectively over thousands of years.

As The ENQUIRER previously reported, Angelina’s weight has plummeted to a spindly 93 pounds while she’s been directing the film “Unbroken” in Australia. The 38-year-old mother of six was said to have collapsed on the set from exhaustion. Her rail-thin physique has also contributed to unsightly bulging veins in her arms that a source says she plans to combat with laser surgery.

While her fiance BRAD PITT has tried everything to persuade her to eat more, “there’s no talking to Angie when it comes to food,” the source added.

“The fact that Angie’s replacing her meals with what’s effectively bird food is a huge worry for Brad. Her diet might be healthier but Brad’s telling her she needs to put some meat on those bones! He’s tearing his hair out watching her fade away with each passing day.”
