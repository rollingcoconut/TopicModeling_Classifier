Adult dating site hack exposes sexual secrets of millions
More than 3.5 million people's sexual preferences fetishes and secrets have been exposed after dating site Adult FriendFinder was hacked.
Already some of the adult website's customers are being identified by name.
Adult FriendFinder asks customers to detail their interests and based on those criteria matches people for sexual encounters. The site which boasts 64 million members claims to have ""helped millions of people find traditional partners swinger groups threesomes and a variety of other alternative partners.""
The information Adult FriendFinder collects is extremely personal in nature. When signing up for an account customers must enter their gender which gender they're interested in hooking up with and what kind of sexual situations they desire. Suggestions AdultFriendfinder provides for the ""tell others about yourself"" field include ""I like my partners to tell me what to do in the bedroom"" ""I tend to be kinky"" and ""I'm willing to try some light bondage or blindfolds.""
The hack which took place in March was first uncovered by independent IT security consultant Bev Robb on her blog Teksecurity a month ago. But Robb did not name the site that was hacked. It wasn't until this week when England's Channel 4 News reported on the hack that Adult FriendFinder was named as the victim.
Are you concerned that your private information has been exposed? Tell us your story.
Included in the exposed personal information are customers' email addresses usernames passwords birthdays and zip codes in addition to their sexual preferences. No credit card data has yet been uncovered as part of the hack.
That data is incredibly revealing and potentially damaging.
Andrew Auernheimer a controversial computer hacker who looked through the files used Twitter to publicly identify Adult FriendFinder customers including a Washington police academy commander an FAA employee a California state tax worker and a naval intelligence officer who supposedly tried to cheat on his wife.
Asked why he was doing this Auernheimer said: ""I went straight for government employees because they seem the easiest to shame.""
Millions of others remain unnamed for now but anyone can open the files -- which remain freely available online. That could allow anyone to extort Adult FriendFinder customers.
For instance the security consultant Robb reported that one person whose information was hacked was a 62-year-old Hispanic male from New Jersey who worked in advertising and has a preference for the ""subporno"" forum. That combined with his username and other account details gave Robb enough information to Google him find his real name and find his social media pages.
The information exposed can be particularly devastating to people living in small towns where they are more easily identified. For example one person exposed in the hack is a 40-year old welder from a small Illinois town of a few thousand people. He ""will become anybody's slave"" and lied about his age on the site claiming to be 29.
The breach was carried out by a hacker who goes by the moniker ROR[RG]. In an online hacker forum he said he blackmailed Adult FriendFinder telling the site he would expose the data online unless the company paid him $100000.
On the forum hackers immediately praised ROR[RG] saying they were planning on using the data to attack the victims.
""i am loading these up in the mailer now / i will send you some dough from what it makes / thank you!!"" wrote a hacker who goes by ""MAPS.""
FriendFinder Networks Inc. parent company of Adult FriendFinder and other adult sites and publications including Penthouse said in a statement that it had just become aware of the breach and it is working closely with law enforcement and cyberforensics company Mandiant a FireEye (FEYE) subsidiary.
The company said it doesn't yet know the full scope of the breach but it promised to ""work vigilantly"" noting that FriendFinder Networks ""fully appreciates the seriousness of the issue.""
""We cannot speculate further about this issue but rest assured we pledge to take the appropriate steps needed to protect our customers if they are affected"" the company said.

An online social gaming company owned by the Walt Disney Co. and one of its top executives have agreed to pay a $3 million penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges they illegally amassed and divulged personal information from hundreds of thousands of children without their parents' consent.
The settlement marks the largest civil penalty to date for a violation of the FTC's Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule which requires website operators to notify parents and obtain their consent before collecting using or disclosing children's personal information.""Let's be clear: Whether you are a virtual world a social network or any other interactive site that appeals to kids you owe it to parents and their children to provide proper notice and get proper consent"" Jon Leibowitz chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said in a statement. ""It's the law it's the right thing to do and as today's settlement demonstrates violating COPPA will not come cheap.""
The FTC charged that Howard Marks and Disney's Playdom Inc. a leading developer of online multi-player games including Pony Stars 9 Dragons and My Diva Doll disclosed personal information on several hundred thousand children under the age of 13 between 2006 and 2010 while operating 20 ""virtual worlds"" on social networking sites such as Facebook where users played online multi-player games including the aforementioned ones.
The FTC's complaint said at least one of these virtual worlds Pony Stars targeted children while Playdom's other websites also attracted a significant number of kids. Between 2006 and 2010 approximately 403000 children registered as users on the Playdom's general audience sites and another 821000 registered as users on the Pony Stars site.
Playdom and Marks the FTC said accumulated children's ages and email addresses when they registered on their sites and enabled kids to publicly post their full names email addresses instant messenger IDs location and other information on personal profile pages and in online community forums.
Besides failing to notify parents and obtaining their consent to collect and disclose their children's personal information the FTC said Playdom and Marks also violated the COPPA rule by failing to publish clear complete and understandable privacy policies (Playdom's privacy policy falsely promised that children under the age of 13 would be prohibited from posting personal information online.)
Playdom took control of the websites in May 2010 when it acquired the original developer Acclaim Games Inc. Marks was Acclaim's CEO and ran the Acclaim Studio after the company was purchased by Playdom. Marks and Playdom the FTC charged continued to operate the websites in violation of the COPPA rule after the deal. Disney acquired Playdom in July 2010 for $563 million.
In addition to the $3 million fine the settlement permanently bars the defendants from violating the COPPA Rule and from misrepresenting their information practices regarding children.

PlayStation Network hack: why it took Sony seven days to tell the world
Sony's company blog says forensic analysis of the PlayStation Network hack took 'several days' to complete and extent of intrusion wasn't understood until Tuesday
Sony's PlayStation Network was hacked in one of the largest internet security break-ins ever. Photograph: Yuriko Nakao/Reuters
Last modified on Wednesday 23 December 2015 11.52EST
Sony has admitted that it shut down its PlayStation Network last week because it discovered a ""non-gaming"" intrusion into the system but had not realised until late on Tuesday  following forensic security testing  that the breach had led to the theft of the data of the 77 million users.
Security analysts said that the problem may mean that hackers have uncovered a fundamental flaw in Sony's networks which will be expensive and time-consuming to fix.
The company has suggested that an ""unauthorised person"" carried out the attack against its servers during which usernames passwords credit card details security answers purchase history and addresses are believed to have been stolen.
The precise method by which the hacker broke into the systems has not been revealed though earlier this year the encryption around the PlayStation 3 was cracked. That would have made software piracy on the PS3 simpler but it's not clear if it would have enabled the wider break-in.
The Anonymous activist group which had criticised Sony over its legal threats to people who exploited the encryption crack has insisted it was not involved in the attack that brought down the network.
The breach has affected two separate Sony networks: the PlayStation Network (PSN) which serves the roughly 55m PS3 consoles and PlayStation Portable owners and its paid-for Qriocity music-streaming service.
The company has hinted that it may refund users for lost services and games.
Accounts on the PSN are free to start and users only need to provide credit card details if they decide to purchase games. But the revelation that details have been stolen indicates that Sony was storing them in unencrypted form  which is a major security error that even small websites avoid.
Having user emails and passwords could lead malicious users to steal all sorts of other personal details especially because many people use the same password on multiple sites  a security failing caused by the problem of remembering multiple different logins.
Alan Paller research director of the SANS Institute told Reuters that the breach might be the largest identity theft on record. Although bigger break-ins in terms of the number of credit cards potentially stolen have been recorded those have been limited to names and card numbers. The detail here is a far richer trove which could be worth tens of millions of dollars if sold on the thriving online black market for credit cards and personal information.
Paller suggested that Sony overlooked security in building the network with the PS3 launch five years ago. ""They have to innovate rapidly. That's the business model"" Paller said. ""New software has errors in it. So they expose code with errors in it to large numbers of people which is a catastrophe in the making.""
Elsewhere the website VG247 said it had obtained a log of a hacker conversation from February in which two hackers said that it was easy to break into the PSN and defeat its encryption. ""Sony is the biggest spy ever  they collect so much data"" one hacker comments in the log. ""All connected devices return values sent to Sony servers. it collects when I had a USB device attached. So if they ever sue someone for PSN stuff they will be sued themselves as most of the data they collect is just not legal.""
Sony sought to explain to PlayStation owners why it has taken seven days to reveal the extent of last week's PSN hack. In a post on the company's blog Nick Caplin head of communications at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued this statement:
""There's a difference in timing between when we identified there was an intrusion and when we learned of consumers' data being compromised. We learned there was an intrusion 19th April and subsequently shut the services down. We then brought in outside experts to help us learn how the intrusion occurred and to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident.
It was necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis and it took our experts until yesterday to understand the scope of the breach. We then shared that information with our consumers and announced it publicly yesterday evening.""
Sony has also produced an FAQ to inform gamers about the security breach. It reiterates the huge extent of the intrusion: names addresses birthdates PSN passwords and credit card numbers for any of the network's 77 million customers who provided such information may have been acquired.
With thousands of gamers livid that their details have been compromised the Sony FAQ does briefly address the question of refunds on subscriptions and purchases: ""When the full services are restored and the length of the outage is known we will assess the correct course of action.""

Facebook opens data hose to journalists with Signal
Signal is pegged as a curation tool for journalists but it also hints at how Facebook's data eventually could be used at broader scale.
Facebook on Thursday released Signal a dashboard where journalists can monitor trending topics and source content as part of their writing process.
Signal pulls from both Facebook and Instagram and allows journalists the opportunity to ""monitor which topics are trending and then quickly display related content that has been shared publicly -- unranked and in chronological order -- from both people and Pages for deeper context on those trends"" according to a blog post from Andy Mitchell director of media partnerships at Facebook.
A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers
Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.
The service leverages a combination of technology from CrowdTangled Storyful and Facebook's own Media Solutions APIs. Signal's APIs are embeddable which means they could also be used for content feeds
or as a way to display coverage of an event. In terms of strategy Signal marks yet another Facebook product that courts the news industry. Last week the social network rolled out the Mentions app to all of its verified profiles giving public figures the ability to broadcast live video feeds or post directly to their followers.Earlier this year the company launched Instant Articles giving news junkies natively hosted articles so they can spend more time on Facebook and started displaying trending topics on a sidebar.But looking beyond Facebook's fascination with becoming a media hub the launch of Signal shows that the social network is finding more ways to use its data on a broader scale. Twitter has long tapped into the power of its data -- the platform is already a major asset for journalists politicians and financial traders.Facebook on the other hand is not yet synonymous with its data despite the obscene amount that it generates each day from its millions of users. A tool like Signal could be just a starting point for Facebook to springboard data products for use in various industries.

pri_250_db,google search autocomplete links german prime mini.txt,"Google Autocomplete: Former GermanFirst Lady Defamation Case - SPIEGEL ONLINE
>Google Autocomplete: Former GermanFirst Lady Defamation Case
AutocompletingBettina Wulff: Can a Google Function Be Libelous?
Search engines attempt to guess what users are looking for and offer them suggested words. But can these terms constitute defamation? Former German first lady Bettina Wulff says they do and is suing Google over searches that pair her name with terms like ""prostitute."" Google maintains it is an automatic mechanism.
The problem has its roots in the American service mentality. One could presumably imagine Google as a somewhat overzealous assistant. ""Rest your fingers"" says the friendly search engine provider. Right from the very first letter that we type in the search box it rushes to guess what we might be looking for. ""S."" Is it SPIEGEL? Samsung? Savings and loan? Skype?
It's pure service-mindedness but for Bettina Wulff it's a nightmare. The wife of former German President Christian Wulff wants the search engine to cease suggesting terms that she finds defamatory. This has nothing to do with the search results but rather with the recommendations made by Google's ""Autocomplete"" function a service that is also offered by competitors like Bing and Yahoo. All one has to do is type her first name and the first letter of her last name to get search suggestions such as ""Bettina Wulff prostitute"" ""Bettina Wulff escort"" and ""Bettina Wulff red-light district.""
Google acts as if all this were unavoidable. ""The search terms in Google Autocomplete reflect the actual search terms of all users"" says a company spokesman. He also spoke of the ""algorithmic result of several objective factors including the popularity of search terms"" which sounds far more complex and typically vague but basically amounts to the same shoulder-shrugging response: One cannot accuse an automatic mechanism of defamation. The company maintains that the search engine only shows what exists. It's not its fault argues Google if someone doesn't like the computed results.
Google increasingly influences how we perceive the world. What are we more afraid of? That behind the computing processes stands a merciless machine or the opaque and arbitrary decisions of a large US corporation?
Both are to be feared and in the case of Google both come into play. Contrary to what the Google spokesman suggests the displayed search terms are by no means solely based on objective calculations. And even if that were the case just because the search engine means no harm it doesn't mean that it does no harm. The Autocomplete function the usefulness of which Google so guilelessly praises as a means of giving one's fingers a rest undeniably helps spread rumors. Assuming that someone unsuspectingly begins to look for information on ""Bettina Wulff"" and is offered ""prostitute"" ""Hanover"" and ""dress"" as additional search terms -- where independent of their actual interests will users most likely click?
And everyone who selects the most exciting suggestion adds to the popularity of this search and thus increases the probability that others will see this suggestion in the future.
Perhaps this is one reason why we find these functions and their algorithms so unsettling -- because they so relentlessly expose human behavior. Google is a rumormonger for the simple reason that people are rumormongers. When we hear that there is a rumor concerning Bettina Wulff we want the details.
Who looked up these terms so diligently that they became popular enough to appear in the Autocomplete suggestion box in the first place? Indeed such unsubstantiated rumors don't reach the top of the search list by merely surfacing on some obscure website in a dark corner of the Web. It may well have been the politicians and journalists who spread the false rumor that Ms. Wulff had been a prostitute -- a rumor she has vehemently denied.
For many months they looked so hard and long for details on the Internet that the algorithms at Google and other search engines eventually concluded that it would be helpful to suggest the term ""prostitute"" to people who were looking for ""Bettina Wulff"" -- just as they recommend ""iphone 5"" to people who type in ""iph.""
Anyone who looks for ""Angela Merkel"" will depending on their country location be given ""Zeuthen"" as an additional search term. After pursuing the initial results here they will find fairly skeptical news stories about the rumor that the chancellor supposedly wants to move to this town southeast of Berlin.
Until recently anyone who followed the search suggestions on Bettina Wulff found no newspaper articles no professional search results and no denials only the rumor itself. Anyone with a little imagination -- and on the Internet there are certainly people who fall into this category -- could see a conspiracy in the deafening silence of the traditional media on a story that appeared to permeate the Web. The fact that the purported story was not being reported made the rumor even more plausible for those who were spreading it.
In fact there was apparently a tacit agreement among journalists not to report on the rumor despite the fact that so many people had heard it. Even critical reporting aimed at refuting the rumor was off-limits no doubt due to concerns that Ms. Wulff would take legal action against the publishers.
This case shows how dangerous it can be in the age of the Internet when the traditional media don't report on an issue -- even if it is with the best of intentions. The rumor of Ms. Wulff's alleged past life took on special importance and apparent credibility when news leaked that her husband the German president felt that he was being pressured by the editor-in-chief of the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
Anyone who had heard the rumor about his wife could suddenly see a reason to suspect that Wulff was not just concerned about reporting on allegations over a loan for his home but also on his wife's alleged ""red-light past."" This could not be denied of course because the rumor was already off-limits.
Google promotes its Chrome browser with the slogan: ""The Web is what you make of it."" That is also an accurate description of how the Autocomplete function works. The more we search for dark secrets the more dark secrets others will discover.
On the other hand it would be wrong to see the search suggestions as allegations and to see something negative in every factually incorrect term. Anyone who looks up German national soccer team coach ""Jogi Lw"" on Google is given ""gay"" in German as an additional suggested search term. The top search results though lead to texts in which Lw denies this rumor. Is it good or bad that Google can thus contribute both to spreading and denying rumors?
And which terms should search engines no longer be allowed to suggest in connection with the name Bettina Wulff to avoid leading unsuspecting users to defamatory content and as she argues in her case against Google to avoid being guilty of making false allegations? The list of taboo words that her lawyer has presented not only contains the specific name of a bordello but also the phrase ""wild past life."" It appears impossible to create a comprehensive list of terms and phrases that eliminates all possible words that could indirectly point to the incriminating rumor.
For the search engines this is not merely a question of practicality but rather a matter of principle. They deny that a combination of terms the algorithm generates as a suggestion constitutes an allegation. More importantly they deny that they are responsible for the word combinations created by such an algorithm. They argue that the displayed content is generated by others -- in this case by other users of the search engine.
Google refuses to accept any responsibility for what people search for -- and for what they find.
Nevertheless search engine providers can intervene in the functioning of the mechanism. Indeed they already do so. The Autocomplete help page says that Google uses ""a narrow set of removal policies for pornography violence hate speech and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights.""
Google doesn't suggest words in Autocomplete like ""bomb"" ""porn"" and ""torrent"" (a term used when searching for file-sharing websites) no matter how popular they may be. Bing and Yahoo have differing criteria but also block certain suggestions.
Search engine providers evidently recognize that it can be problematic if they suggest certain terms to their users and they have taken appropriate action to ensure that this does not happen. But they do not disclose the criteria they use to make those decisions.
Why for instance should the interests of the film industry which wants to avoid suggesting that anyone look for pirated copies of their works outweigh the personal rights of Ms. Wulff?
On the other hand the suggestions made by the Google algorithm are often in the interests of users when they are not in the interests of the individuals or companies concerned. For example a service provider who used dubious methods to convince companies to purchase high-priced listings in a business directory sued Google because his name came up in connection with search suggestions such as ""rip-off"" and ""fraud."" A regional appeals court in Munich ruled that the suggestions did not represent Google's own content but rather ""third-party content namely search requests from previous users of the search engine"" and dismissed the claim. Google has lost similar cases however in France and Italy.
The current conflict resembles the legal battle between Max Mosley and Google. The former president of FIA the governing body for world motor sport wants Google to stop making it possible to locate illegal photos of him online. He wants them to be automatically filtered out of the search results.
This case alone leads to a complex dilemma over whether or not it is good if Google has to monitor its search results -- good for the company good for those concerned or good for society? On its own initiative the Google subsidiary YouTube has decided to block links in Egypt and Libya to the Islamophobic film ""Innocence of Muslims"" which has sparked outrage and violence in the Islamic world.
The debate over the Autocomplete function is based on the same fundamental conflict. In fact the function exacerbates the conflict because individual users do not actively have to search for possibly legally contentious content. Instead Google brings it to their attention.
When a passive search engine morphs into an active suggestion generator it makes Google's controversial role even more complex namely its function as a medium for perceiving and determining reality. It is hard to imagine a law or legal decision that would provide a fair and practicable solution to these conflicts.
At the same time the problems that the Autocomplete function creates for those concerned and ultimately also for Google appear to be in no way commensurate with the advantages enjoyed by its users namely a little convenience speed and a ""rest for the fingers.""
Google could simply discontinue this feature without seriously compromising its functionality as a search engine. But refusing to do so is of course also a matter of principle.
Both are to be feared and in the case of Google both come into play. Contrary to what the Google spokesman suggests the displayed search terms are by no means solely based on objective calculations. And even if that were the [...]

So it's the user who decides and since the majority of people believes that being a prostitute is dingy let alone accept it as occupation which it is officially it must be a nightmare to find out that Google offers automatically the words prostitute and escort when typing in your name. It's no allegation of course but a damage to your reputation. I think it's not the fault of the algorithm. Google would be wise to delete some offers however. I can't be so difficult.

Confirmed: Google's Siri-Esque Personal Assistant Is Creepy
Google's all-knowing Siri-esque personal assistant has confirmed some suspicions veering from cool feature into creepy stalker territory. When Google announced Google Now -- a service that ""gets you just the right information at just the right time"" as Google explains it -- some like Bits Blog's Jenna Wortham suggested the all-knowingness might come off as creepy even if it's useful. From the looks of the service which we get fromBusiness Insider's Steve Kovach it does indeed sound like the service keeps a very close eye on us begging the question: How much do we want our computers to know about us?
Not as much as Google Now at least from Kovach's experience. Having the latest Android software Kovach has gotten his hands on the product. And like a creepy bot it already knows lots and lots about him monitoring everything he does online to guess what he'll need before he knows it. Some examples:
It knows his favorite sports teams: I'm a Mets fan (unfortunately) so a lot of my sports-related Google searches are for the score of the latest game. Google knows this so Google Now automatically sends me notifications with the latest score. I don't even have to ask anymore.
It knows his friends which is creepy not just for Kovach. The other night I was getting dinner with a few old journalism friends from college. We were talking about Jim Romenesko and one of my friends wondered how old he was. I asked Google Now ""How old is Jim Romenesko?"" The answer came up in less than a second.
Though Kovach doesn't find any of this an overreach calling the service ""better than Siri at pulling up relevant information"" it sounds a little too all-knowing to us and we image for Wortham. ""It gets weird when Google starts to extend its reach into that territory because Google already knows so much about us  things like who we e-mail and talk to the most along with what we search for"" writes Wortham. ""When those smaller bits of data begin to get linked together in a more meaningful way that knowledge can take on a larger different context"" she continues.
In the digital personal assistant world it's not human-like qualities -- a.k.a the uncanny valley -- that makes these programs creepy but rather the kind of information they have. That Google Now knows about us in a more than Google-search-able way makes the service feel like an intrusion. To be sure Siri knows things too. And it even talks (and jokes) like a human. But Siri does not take note of our habits like some weird stalker friend. We don't have an aversion to the Apple version because it still has a robot brain. Google Now on the other hand not only has a human brain it has a nosy omniscient one. That we find creepy. And considering all the privacy issues Google has gotten into of late we doubt we're alone here.

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield sued for hacking incident
To embed copy and paste the code into your website or blog:
Not to be left out plaintiffs filed suit against CareFirst BlueCross Blue Shield late last week for the hacking incident the insurer suffered in May which resulted in unknown intruders gaining access to names dates of birth email addresses and subscriber identification numbers of approximately 1.1 million members. CareFirst has indicated that the incident did not include a compromise of members Social Security numbers or credit card information.
Despite this plaintiffs allege in the complaint that they had a reasonable expectation that their personal information and health information would be kept confidential. Although the plaintiffs allege that the plaintiffs have been damaged and have lost or are subject to losing money and property as a result of the incident it will be interesting to see what actual damages are alleged to have been suffered when Social Security numbers were not exposed.
Further the plaintiffs allege that their personal information can be used by identity thieves to perpetrate a variety of crimes that harm the victims but the case does not explain how the information involved can actually be used or has been used against the named plaintiffs.
This is another case we will be watching and reporting on as this area of the law develops and class action lawsuits become the norm following data breaches.

pri_250_db,consumers voice privacy concerns about online reta.txt,"Seeing That Ad on Every Site? You're Right. It's Tracking You. - NYTimes.com
campaign: abTest_bar1_ft_upsell_nyt_0116 -- 282911 creative: abTest_bar1_ft_upsell_nyt_0116_ad -- 412102 page: www.nytimes.com/archive/article/archives targetedPage: www.nytimes.com/archive/article position: Bar1
Seeing That Ad on Every Site? You're Right. It's Tracking You.
The shoes that Julie Matlin recently saw on Zappos.com were kind of cute or so she thought. But Ms. Matlin wasn't ready to buy and left the site.
Then the shoes started to follow her everywhere she went online. An ad for those very shoes showed up on the blog TechCrunch. It popped up again on several other blogs and on Twitpic. It was as if Zappos had unleashed a persistent salesman who wouldn't take no for an answer.
''For days or weeks every site I went to seemed to be showing me ads for those shoes'' said Ms. Matlin a mother of two from Montreal. ''It is a pretty clever marketing tool. But it's a little creepy especially if you don't know what's going on.''
People have grown accustomed to being tracked online and shown ads for categories of products they have shown interest in be it tennis or bank loans.
Increasingly however the ads tailored to them are for specific products that they have perused online. While the technique which the ad industry calls personalized retargeting or remarketing is not new it is becoming more pervasive as companies like Google and Microsoft have entered the field. And retargeting has reached a level of precision that is leaving consumers with the palpable feeling that they are being watched as they roam the virtual aisles of online stores.
More retailers like Art.com B&H; Photo Diapers.com eBags.com and the Discovery Channel store use these kinds of ads. Nordstrom says it is considering using them and retargeting is becoming increasingly common with marketers in the travel real estate and financial services industries. The ads often appear on popular sites like YouTube Facebook MySpace or Realtor.com.
In the digital advertising business this form of highly personalized marketing is being hailed as the latest breakthrough because it tries to show consumers the right ad at the right time. ''The overwhelming response has been positive'' said Aaron Magness senior director for brand marketing and business development at Zappos a unit of Amazon.com. The parent company declined to say whether it also uses the ads.
Others though find it disturbing. When a recent Advertising Age column noted the phenomenon several readers chimed in to voice their displeasure.
Bad as it was to be stalked by shoes Ms. Matlin said that she felt even worse when she was hounded recently by ads for a dieting service she had used online. ''They are still following me around and it makes me feel fat'' she said.
With more consumers queasy about intrusions into their privacy the technique is raising anew the threat of industry regulation. ''Retargeting has helped turn on a light bulb for consumers'' said Jeff Chester a privacy advocate and executive director of the Washington-based Center for Digital Democracy. ''It illustrates that there is a commercial surveillance system in place online that is sweeping in scope and raises privacy and civil liberties issues too.''
Retargeting however relies on a form of online tracking that has been around for years and is not particularly intrusive. Retargeting programs typically use small text files called cookies that are exchanged when a Web browser visits a site. Cookies are used by virtually all commercial Web sites for various purposes including advertising keeping users signed in and customizing content.
In remarketing when a person visits an e-commerce site and looks at say an Etienne Aigner Athena satchel on eBags.com a cookie is placed into that person's browser linking it with the handbag. When that person or someone using the same computer visits another site the advertising system creates an ad for that very purse.
Mr. Magness of Zappos said that consumers may be unnerved because they may feel that they are being tracked from site to site as they browse the Web. To reassure consumers Zappos which is using the ads to peddle items like shoes handbags and women's underwear displays a message inside the banner ads that reads ''Why am I seeing these ads?'' When users click on it they are taken to the Web site of Criteo the advertising technology company behind the Zappos ads where the ads are explained.
While users are given the choice to opt out few do once they understand how the ads are selected for them said Jean-Baptiste Rudelle the chief executive of Criteo.
But some advertising and media experts said that explaining the technology behind the ads might not allay the fears of many consumers who worry about being tracked or who simply fear that someone they share a computer with will see what items they have browsed.
''When you begin to give people a sense of how this is happening they really don't like it'' said Joseph Turow a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania who has conducted consumer surveys about online advertising. Professor Turow who studies digital media and recently testified at a Senate committee hearing on digital advertising said he had a visceral negative reaction to the ads even though he understands the technologies behind them.
''It seemed so bold'' Professor Turow said. ''I was not pleased frankly.''
While start-ups like Criteo and TellApart are among the most active remarketers the technique has also been embraced by online advertising giants.
Google began testing this technique in 2009 calling it remarketing to connote the idea of customized messages like special offers or discounts being sent to users. In March the company made the service available to all advertisers on its AdWords network.
For Google remarketing is a more specific form of behavioral targeting the practice under which a person who has visited NBA.com for instance may be tagged as a basketball fan and later will be shown ads for related merchandise.
Behavioral targeting has been hotly debated in Washington and lawmakers are considering various proposals to regulate it. During the recent Senate hearing Senator Claire McCaskill Democrat of Missouri said she found the technique troubling. ''I understand that advertising supports the Internet but I am a little spooked out'' Ms. McCaskill said of behavioral targeting. ''This is creepy.''
When Advertising Age the advertising industry publication tackled the subject of remarketing recently the writer Michael Learmonth described being stalked by a pair of pants he had considered buying on Zappos.
''As tracking gets more and more crass and obvious consumers will rightfully become more concerned about it'' he wrote. ''If the industry is truly worried about a federally mandated 'do not track' list akin to 'do not call' for the Internet they're not really showing it.''
Some advertising executives agree that highly personalized remarketing not only goes too far but also is unnecessary.
''I don't think that exposing all this detailed information you have about the customer is necessary'' said Alan Pearlstein chief executive of Cross Pixel Media a digital marketing agency. Mr. Pearlstein says he supports retargeting but with more subtle ads that for instance could offer consumers a discount coupon if they return to an online store. ''What is the benefit of freaking customers out?''

Business Day|In a Mood? Call Center Agents Can Tell
IN a YouTube clip from one of Steve Jobss last interviews he appears to be enjoying reminiscing about how he first hit upon the idea for the keyboardless tablet that eventually became the iPad.
I had this idea of being able to get rid of the keyboard type on a multitouch glass display and I asked our folks could we come up with a multitouch display that I could type on I could rest my hands on and actually type on Mr. Jobs says smiling slightly as he recounts his enthusiasm at seeing the first prototype. It was amazing.But in a billboard superimposed over the nearly two-minute video clip an emotion analytics company called Beyond Verbal has added its own algorithmic evaluation of Mr. Jobss underlying feelings. It is an emotion detection system meant to parse not the meanings of peoples words but the intonations of their voices.Conflict between urges and self-control. Loneliness fatigue emotional frustration the ticker above Mr. Jobss head reports as he speaks. Moments later it suggests a further diagnosis: Insistence stubbornness. Possibly childish egoism. And then concludes: sadness mixed with happiness. Possibly nostalgia.Humans generally have inklings when their interlocutors out of solicitousness or sarcasm utter phrases aloud that contradict their inner feelings: Thanks a bunch. Youve been very helpful. Wish I were there. Lets have lunch.But now new techniques in computational voice analysis are promising to help machines identify when smiley-sounding phrases like Mr. Jobss belie frustration and grief within. Although the software is still in its early phases developers like Beyond Verbal a start-up in Tel Aviv are offering the nascent technology as a deeper approach for call centers and other customer services that seek to read and respond to consumers emotions in real time. The company says its software can detect 400 variations of different moods.Its not what you say. Its how you say it says Dan Emodi vice president for marketing at Beyond Verbal. Listening to these patterns we can allow machines for the first time to understand the emotional side of our communications.
The more invasive audio mining also has the potential to unnerve some consumers who might squirm at the idea of an unknown operator getting an instant entree into their psyche.Industry analysts say companies that adopt emotion detection should be transparent with consumers alerting them to the uses and analysis of their data beyond the standard disclosure to which weve become inured: This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.Its a potential privacy issue capturing a consumer mining that conversation says Donna Fluss the president of DMG Consulting a market research firm focused on the call center industry. What are they doing with that information?Another question is whether emotion detection is any more valid than novelties like handwriting analysis. After all only Steve Jobs could say how he really felt during that interview.
It seems to me that the biggest risk of this technology is not that it violates peoples privacy but that companies might believe in it and use it to make judgments about customers or potential employees says George Loewenstein a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. That could end up being used to make arbitrary and potentially discriminatory decisions.FOR more than a decade call centers have generally recorded every service request complaint diatribe account closure and nuisance call from consumers. In the early days of these recordings companies archived the calls and reviewed a handful of them after the fact examining the conversation patterns and giving agents feedback on their performance.But as software and server power have improved call centers are using a more advanced approach called word spotting to examine each call. In fact the business of analyzing words and their sentiments called speech analytics is a $214 million market according to estimates from DMG Consulting and used in finance insurance health travel retailing and telecommunications.Call centers for instance can program their speech engines to search for specific words or phrases  like This is the third time I have called in! or Ive been a loyal customer for 10 years!  which tend to be emotionally charged indicating mounting consumer dissatisfaction.We record and mine every single call every single word and phrase says Daniel Ziv vice president for voice-of-the-customer analytics at Verint a leading speech analytics company. One of my favorites is You people! or This is ridiculous! Its unlikely that people are using ridiculous in a positive playful way.Another call center analytics company called CallMiner classifies consumers spoken words into categories like dissatisfaction or escalation. Speech analytics engines can also be used to search consumer calls for unexpected events or trends like a sudden problem with product delivery or using gift cards.If you can identify the problem get to the root cause and fix it you can save millions of dollars says Ryan Hollenbeck Verints senior vice president for marketing.Beyond Verbal is proposing a different tactic with algorithms that ignore emotional trigger words like ridiculous in favor of voice qualities like tone and frequency.Company executives say their technique is based on the work of Israeli researchers in the 1990s who studied how babies understand and respond to the moods of adult speech before understanding actual language. The researchers developed their mood-detection algorithms by analyzing the emotions of 70000 people in 30 languages. Company executives say the software can detect not only callers primary and secondary moods but also their attitudes and underlying personalities.It helps agents decide how to respond. If theres a customer-is-always-right type you want to give them proper appreciation and respect Mr. Emodi says. If the caller is seeking friendship the agent should speak in a friendly direct way.
He and other company executives envision a variety of commercial uses for emotion detection. Consumers might use it to analyze and modulate their own voices as could public speakers. People who wish to test out the accuracy of the emotion meter for themselves can check out the mood recognition app on the companys site.Executives say a few companies are working on call-center applications for the software and they expect the first of those apps to be ready for use around the end of this year. The idea is to use it not just to identify and mollify dissatisfied callers but also to help agents distinguish between frustrated callers who wish to solve a problem and are worth spending more time on from angry callers who want merely to vent.Yuval Mor the chief executive of Beyond Verbal says the program can also pinpoint and influence how consumers make decisions. He calls it deciphering the human emotional genome.If this person is an innovator you want to offer the latest and greatest product Mr. Mor says. If this person is a more conservative person you dont want to offer the latest and greatest but something tried and true.But peoples voices change over time and depending on different situations says Professor Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon. So categorizing a consumer based on one phone call could be commercially irrelevant over the long-term.They are just reading your voice at one moment in time. You are not going to read someones personality from their voice Professor Loewenstein says. In my view we are very far from that being a reality.Even without a mood detection algorithm you can classify that emotion: skepticism.

Concern for Vast Social Services Database on the Citys Neediest
Sabrina Leckey arranges emergency housing for Iredelisa Sanchez and her son at the Path Family Intake Center in the Bronx.
New York City has spent the past 18 months developing a database on four million residents most of them the citys neediest which officials say will enhance social services but which advocates for the poor say could put their privacy at risk.
Using data-sharing concepts developed by the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies the database links together vast amounts of information gathered by city agencies that previously maintained their files separately.Now workers in an array of city departments will have access to information about nearly half of the citys residents including welfare and food stamp payments child care vouchers and records of Medicaid enrollment and stays in public housing and shelters among other kinds of social service records.City officials said the database which has been tested in some offices since last summer would improve services by supplying verified information that people do not frequently carry with them may not remember or may not wish to divulge. It could be used they say to locate noncustodial parents to fill out Medicaid applications so public hospitals can be quickly reimbursed for treatment to respond to 311 calls or to find mothers with newborn babies who are eligible for home health visits.What drove us was this vision around more holistic treatment of families said Linda Gibbs the deputy mayor for health and human services.Advocates for the poor say it is true that their clients often fall through the cracks because of the lack of communication between city agencies. But they also worry that the network may perpetuate mistakes allow city workers to fish for personal information about clients and violate privacy.The brave new world is actually here said Steven Banks attorney in chief for the Legal Aid Society.In its initial stages the project called Worker Connect which cost $28 million to develop draws selected data from the Administration for Childrens Services the child welfare agency; the Department of Homeless Services; the Housing Authority; records of seniors rent subsidies from the Department of Finance; and the Human Resources Administration which administers Medicaid welfare and food stamps in the city.
But thousands of workers in nine city agencies will have access to the information including employees from Family Court legal services child protection the Department for the Aging corrections public hospitals and domestic violence prevention.The technology is based on the National Information Exchange Model known as NIEM which was started in 2005 by the federal Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The exchange model helps agencies with different types of databases communicate and has been used for example to allow the police to track warrants across state boundaries.More recently the federal Department of Health and Human Services joined the NIEM executive steering council and is promoting the shared data model for efforts like preventing Medicare fraud and enforcing child support.

Concern for Vast Social Services Database on the Citys Neediest
Sabrina Leckey arranges emergency housing for Iredelisa Sanchez and her son at the Path Family Intake Center in the Bronx.
New York City has spent the past 18 months developing a database on four million residents most of them the citys neediest which officials say will enhance social services but which advocates for the poor say could put their privacy at risk.
Using data-sharing concepts developed by the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies the database links together vast amounts of information gathered by city agencies that previously maintained their files separately.Now workers in an array of city departments will have access to information about nearly half of the citys residents including welfare and food stamp payments child care vouchers and records of Medicaid enrollment and stays in public housing and shelters among other kinds of social service records.City officials said the database which has been tested in some offices since last summer would improve services by supplying verified information that people do not frequently carry with them may not remember or may not wish to divulge. It could be used they say to locate noncustodial parents to fill out Medicaid applications so public hospitals can be quickly reimbursed for treatment to respond to 311 calls or to find mothers with newborn babies who are eligible for home health visits.What drove us was this vision around more holistic treatment of families said Linda Gibbs the deputy mayor for health and human services.Advocates for the poor say it is true that their clients often fall through the cracks because of the lack of communication between city agencies. But they also worry that the network may perpetuate mistakes allow city workers to fish for personal information about clients and violate privacy.The brave new world is actually here said Steven Banks attorney in chief for the Legal Aid Society.In its initial stages the project called Worker Connect which cost $28 million to develop draws selected data from the Administration for Childrens Services the child welfare agency; the Department of Homeless Services; the Housing Authority; records of seniors rent subsidies from the Department of Finance; and the Human Resources Administration which administers Medicaid welfare and food stamps in the city.
But thousands of workers in nine city agencies will have access to the information including employees from Family Court legal services child protection the Department for the Aging corrections public hospitals and domestic violence prevention.The technology is based on the National Information Exchange Model known as NIEM which was started in 2005 by the federal Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The exchange model helps agencies with different types of databases communicate and has been used for example to allow the police to track warrants across state boundaries.More recently the federal Department of Health and Human Services joined the NIEM executive steering council and is promoting the shared data model for efforts like preventing Medicare fraud and enforcing child support. The city intends to contribute to those efforts Ms. Gibbs said.
Other places across the country like Montgomery County Md. and Alameda County Calif. are developing similar projects but New Yorks version dwarfs them in size and planning.Ms. Gibbs said that if it could work out its privacy issues the city might expand the database to include other information like records of domestic violence and public school records which would include more than one million students at any given time.

Sony Corp's Executive Deputy President Kazuo Hirai speaks at a news conference to apologise for a massive security breach of its PlayStation Network in Tokyo May 1 2011.
Security practitioners weigh in on the 15 worst data security breaches in recent memory.
Data security breaches happen daily in too many places at once to keep count. But what constitutes a huge breach versus a small one? For some perspective we take a look at 15 of the biggest incidents in recent memory. Helping us out are security practitioners from a variety of industries including more than a dozen members of LinkedIn's Information Security Community who provided nominations for the list.

Impact: 134 million credit cards exposed through SQL injection to install spyware on Heartland's data systems.
A federal grand jury indicted Albert Gonzalez and two unnamed Russian accomplices in 2009. Gonzalez a Cuban-American was alleged to have masterminded the international operation that stole the credit and debit cards. In March 2010 he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The vulnerability to SQL injection was well understood and security analysts had warned retailers about it for several years. Yet the continuing vulnerability of many Web-facing applications made SQL injection the most common form of attack against Web sites at the time.
There are conflicting accounts about how this happened. One supposes that a group of hackers took advantage of a weak data encryption system and stole credit card data during a wireless transfer between two Marshall's stores in Miami Fla. The other has them breaking into the TJX network through in-store kiosks that allowed people to apply for jobs electronically. According to KNOS Project cofounder and chief architect Kevin McAleavey this was possible because TJX's network wasn't protected by any firewalls. Albert Gonzalez hacking legend and ringleader of the Heartland breach was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison while 11 others were arrested.
Impact: Exposed names and e-mails of millions of customers stored in more than 108 retail stores plus several huge financial firms like CitiGroup Inc. and the non-profit educational organization College Board.
The source of the breach is still undetermined but tech experts say it could lead to numerous phishing scams and countless identity theft claims. There are different views on how damaging the Epsilon breach was. Bruce Schneier chief security technology officer at BT and a prolific author wrote in a blog post at the time that ""Yes millions of names and e-mail addresses (and) other customer information might have been stolen. Yes this personal information could be used to create more personalized and better-targeted phishing attacks. So what? These sorts of breaches happen all the time and even more personal information is stolen."" Still Kevin McAleavey of the KNOS Project says the breach is being estimated as a $4 billion dollar loss. Since Epsilon has a client list of more than 2200 global brands and handles more than 40 billion e-mails annually he says it could be ""the biggest if not the most expensive security breach of all-time.""

Experian data breach hits more than 15M T-Mobile customers applicants
Experian data breach affects 15M T-Mobile customers reports CNBC's Sue Herera.
Global information services group Experian announced Thursday that one of its business units had been hacked. The breach occurred on a server that contained data on behalf of one of its clients T-Mobile.
The data includes personal information for a combination of about 15 million customers and applicants in the U.S. who at one point may have applied for T-Mobile service. The company said that the incident did not impact its own consumer credit database.
The data also included applicants requiring a credit check for service or device financing from Sept. 1 2013 through Sept. 16 2015 Experian North America said in a statement.
The ADRs of Ireland-headquartered Experian closed Thursday up nearly 1.7 percent to $16.38 while shares of T-Mobile were down more than 1 percent in extended trading.
In a letter to consumers T-Mobile CEO John Legere said the following:
""Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian but right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected. I take our customer and prospective customer privacy VERY seriously. This is no small issue for us. I do want to assure our customers that neither T-Mobile's systems nor network were part of this intrusion and this did not involve any payment card numbers or bank account information.""
Legere also said that any customers concerned that they may have been impacted can sign up for two years of free credit monitoring and identity resolution services at Experian's ""Protect My ID"" program.
Experian said it took immediate action upon finding the breach: it secured the server initiated a comprehensive investigation and notified U.S. and international law enforcement.
The data stolen included names dates of birth addresses and Social Security numbers. No payment card or banking information was acquired the company said.
""We take privacy very seriously and we understand that this news is both stressful and frustrating.
We sincerely apologize for the concern and stress that this event may cause"" said Craig Boundy CEO of Experian North America. ""That is why we're taking steps to provide protection and support to those affected by this incident and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement during its investigation.""

pri_250_db,"in some cases, the facebook user id could be infer.txt","Facebook logoEmail or PhonePasswordKeep me logged inForgot your password?Sign UpProtecting Privacy with ReferrersBy Matt Jones on Monday May 24 2010 at 8:24pmLate last week we quickly fixed an issue after being contacted by a Wall Street Journal reporter regarding an unintentional oversight in the data shared with our advertisers by your browser when you click some ads on Facebook. This occurred in the referrer link visible to advertisers when someone clicked on an ad. A little background: In some cases the referrer could contain the user ID of a profile you visited including your own but we were not aware of any way that a user ID on the referrer could identify the person who clicked on the ad. We've been testing different solutions to remove user IDs completely from referrer URLs since their inclusion was first brought to our attention.However in a rarely occurring case advertisers knowledgeable about the structure of Facebook's URLs could use the referrer to determine when someone who clicked on an ad had been viewing his or her own profile thus potentially enabling them to infer the user ID of that person. We have no reason to believe that any advertisers were exploiting this and doing so would have been a violation of our terms. To our knowledge none did.It's also important to point out that we don't share personal information with advertisers and we never sell any of your information to anyone. The way our advertising system works is advertisers tell us what types of people they want to reach and we take their ad and serve it accordingly.We want to do far more than the industry standard though. Today we began rolling out a change to completely remove all user IDs from appearing in referrer links before web browsers send the links to external websites including to advertisers. We've been working for the past few months on this change. It is live for the Firefox Chrome Safari and Opera browsers and we're working on a solution for Internet Explorer. Below weve also published technical details of how we made this change so that other websites can use the approach to remove user IDs from their referrer links if they choose.We're confident that this new change along with our earlier fix goes beyond industry standards to further protect your privacy.
The technical implementationHere at Facebook were all about understanding how people interact with our site  including how they end up here from across the vast expanse of the internet.
Were not the only ones though  most web sites want similar insights about the people who use them. Despite its tragic misspelling the HTTP standards referrer header sent by browsers gives websites the information they need to see how users found them and how they explore the sites once there.Referrers: not always welcomeBut sometimes referrers just dont belong  maybe there is sensitive information in a URL or maybe a site just doesnt want its users browsers telling others how they use the site.
While most browsers give their users the option to disable this feature not everyone does so and there is no way for a web site to explicitly tell a browser not to send a referrer.
Facebook is one site where referrers dont really belong.
As part of our continued efforts to protect users privacy we proactively protect our users from exposing how they navigated to an external site.
To this end we have designed a redirector with the following properties.
The redirector must:Successfully redirect in all casesRemove the referrer of the page on which the user clickedStill convey that a click happened on Facebook.comNot be an open redirectorImplementing this functionality in a safe cross-browser way is not a simple task so here we discuss one method for accomplishing it.Our friends the web pagesFor the purposes of this discussion we'll refer to three web pages:A.com/sourceA.com/redirectB.comSuppose the user is viewing content on A.com/source and clicks a link that purports to go to B.com. A.com wishes to send the user to B.com in such a way that B.com knows A.com sent them the click - but without disclosing that the user clicked to their site from A.com/source specifically.
So instead of sending the user directly to B.com they can first send the user to A.com/redirect.
This extra step also has some additional benefits (e.g. the ability to block the redirect if B.com is found to be malicious)  but we wont get into those here. So how can we make this happen?
There are number of approaches each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
You can see each approach outlined in the following table and discussed in detail below it.The discussed redirect methods and the referrers they send in each browser.The 302The simplest way to redirect is with an HTTP 302 Found response and an HTTP header ""Location:http://B.com"".
However in the majority of browsers this type of redirect will show a referrer of ""A.com/source"" - which we don't want.PHP code: header('Location:http://B.com);The RefreshThe next simplest way to redirect is with an HTTP 200 response and an HTTP Refresh header
The behavior of this type of redirect varies across browsers.
In Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE) this type of redirect will result in a blank referrer being sent as the referrer to B.com.
Good for privacy but bad for B.com's ability to understand where its traffic comes from.
We can do better.In Opera and Webkit browsers (Safari Chrome iPhone and Android) this type of redirect will result in ""a.com/redirect"" being sent as the referrer to B.com - perfect!PHP code: header(Refresh:0;URL=http://B.com);The Meta RefreshSimilarly we can send an HTTP 200 response and some HTML with a meta tag.
This is equivalent to sending the Refresh HTTP header.HTML code: <html><head><meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0;URL=http://B.com"" /></head></html>Document.location.replace()Getting a little more tricky assuming the user's browser supports JavaScript we can send an HTTP 200 response and a snippet of JavaScript that says: ""document.location.replace('http://B.com');"".
This type of redirect also behaves differently across browsers.In Firefox Webkit and Opera this type of redirect will result in ""a.com/redirect"" being sent as the referrer to B.com.
Success!In IE this type of redirect will result in a blank referrer being sent to B.com.
Not ideal.HTML code: <html><body><script>document.location.replace(http://B.com);</script></body></html>Anchor click()To find a viable solution on IE we need to be a little bit more clever.
If we again send an HTTP 200 code but some different JavaScript we can make it work.Specifically we can send HTML containing an anchor (<a id=""a"" href=""http://B.com""></a>) tag and some JavaScript that tells the browser to ""click"" it: ""document.getElementById('a').click();"".
One drawback to this approach is that it alters the behavior of the back button.
When this approach is used users who click back on B.com will go back to A.com/redirect and then be immediately re-redirected to B.com. In Firefox and Webkit this completely fails - click() does nothing.In Opera IE6 IE7 and IE8 this sends a referrer of ""a.com/redirect"" to B.com.
Success!HTML code: <html><body onload=""document.getElementById('a').click();""><a id=""a"" href=""http://B.com""></a></body></html>2-way shimmed anchor clickWe can get around the anchor click's annoying behavior by making a.com/redirect a little smarter.
It turns out that IE persists some of the dom state in a.com/redirect even if you navigate away then hit the back button and return to it.
So we store a form with a hidden input that's initialized to 0 and every time a.com/redirect is hit we increment a counter in that hidden input.
If when the page loads the counter is 0 it anchor-click redirects to B.com.
If the counter is even or odd (but >0) it uses window.history.go() to go forwards or backwards accordingly.
(If the counter is odd the user hit ""back."" If it's even they hit ""forward."")
To the user it's truly as if a.com/redirect doesn't exist - almost like the simpler methods in other browsers.Like the vanilla anchor.click() this fails in Firefox and Webkit.In IE this works as expected - and works around the break in the back button.In Opera the first redirect works but unfortunately hitting the back button just leaves you on A.com/redirect.HTML code: <html><head><script>function onloadHandler() {
} else if (parseInt(document.refreshForm.visited.value) % 2 == 1) {
document.refreshForm.visited.value = parseInt(document.refreshForm.visited.value) + 1;
document.refreshForm.visited.value = parseInt(document.refreshForm.visited.value) + 1;
}}</script></head><body onload=""onloadHandler();""><form name=""refreshForm""><input type=""hidden"" name=""visited"" value="""" /></form><a id=""a"" href=""http://B.com""></a></body></html>So we've found redirect methods that work in all the major browsers even if none of them works in every browser.
So all we have to do is look at the user agent when we're rendering A.com/redirect choose the right method and send users on their merry way.Keeping it safeWe also need to make sure that requirement (4) is fulfilled  we need to not be an open redirector.
That is to say that A.com/redirect needs to only work for the person its intended for at the time they clicked it.
parameter that must be correct for the redirect to go through.
This parameter of course does not convey any identifiable information about the user.A backup planThere's one caveat though - what if some users browsers don't support JavaScript they have a plugin that prevents it from executing or these methods otherwise fail?
We still want them to end up on B.com - after all they clicked on its link!
So along with all of these methods we also send a ""Refresh:1;URL=http://B.com"" header which tells the browser to redirect to B.com after 1 second. This way if for some reason the JavaScript redirects fail users will still end up at their destination and everybody wins.
The only drawback to this method is that some browsers send a blank referrer when its used so affected users will send a blank referer.
Since this is only a small percentage of users we can accept this tradeoff.Weve implemented these methods to prevent user IDs and usernames from appearing in referrers sent by browsers when our users visit other sites from Facebook. We hope that other websites with similar needs can use these methods too. We would like support in web browsers for safe redirects but until then were looking for any feedback or ideas for other approaches.

Privacy Issues Hinder Plan on Tracking Terror Assets
MADRID  The United States stands ready to cooperate if plans for a new European Union system for tracking terrorism financing come through a senior Treasury Department official said here on Thursday. But he would not say whether that cooperation would go so far as to share American bank account data.Last month the European Commission the executive body of the European Union unveiled plans to develop a homegrown system to track terrorist finances as a response to a similar American program. Although the American assets-tracking system operates under agreement with the European Union it has been widely criticized as a breach of European citizens privacy. And the commission has stressed that it expects any such European system to require that the United States contribute information on American citizens transactions.Speaking on the eve of a meeting between American and European justice and interior ministers here the American treasury official Stuart A. Levey the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence said Washington was committed to working with any new European system under the basis of reciprocity.Asked whether that might involve allowing European terrorism investigators direct access to data from American bank accounts Mr. Levey would not say. In terms of overall investigative cooperation he said You have to create the right circumstances but we would cooperate.Opposition to the American tracking system has been particularly virulent in the European Parliament whose members have demanded that the European Commission renegotiate the original agreement to strengthen its privacy rules.The American delegation here is headed by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and the homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano. Mr. Holder said Thursday at a news conference that the banking-data agreement was a vital tool and it is important that the program be put back in an active mode as soon as we can.We recognize that there have been questions raised in Europe and one of our goals is to highlight the extensive privacy safeguards that have been put in place Mr. Holder said. Given the nature of the agreement and the effectiveness of the agreement that we had in place before I am confident that we can work our way through the concerns that we had.At the Madrid meeting on Friday the Europeans are also expected to push for more concessions from Washington in order to draw up a new agreement on the sharing of airline passenger data. The current accord struck in 1997 has run into widespread privacy concerns in Europe about the United States handling of personal data.Among these demands the European Union justice commissioner Viviane Reding is expected to seek from her American counterparts a commitment that European citizens would be able to sue in United States courts if they believe that passenger data handed over by airlines has been misused.The meeting in Madrid comes as the United States has begun applying new screening rules for air passengers going to America following an attempted bombing on Dec. 25 on a plane flying from Amsterdam to Detroit. While the rules have received broad endorsement from industry experts they have also met with opposition from European privacy advocates.

Yikes. Users of fitness and calorie tracker Fitbit may need to be more careful when creating a profile on the site. The sexual activity of many of the users of the companys tracker and online platform can be found in Google Search results meaning that these users profiles are public and searchable. You can click here to access these results.
As you may know the Fitbit Tracker is an compact wearable device that clips onto clothing or slips into a pocket and captures through accelerometer technology information about daily health activities such as steps taken distance traveled calories burned exercise intensity levels and sleep quality. Users can also log nutrition weight additional activities (including sexual activity) and other health information on the site in order to gain a complete picture of their health.
So why are Fitbit users profiles able to be searchable in Google? Its not really Fitbits fault. When you create a profile the default privacy setting allows profiles to be found in search results (Google Bing etc). If you dont unclick this setting it will obviously make your profile public for anyone to find.
So these users may be unwittingly sharing their most intimate details (i.e. kissing hugging and more) when recording their sexual activity to calculate how many calories they have burned in a given period of time.
Of course sex does count as exercise but you might want to think twice before recording it on Fitbit and making your profile open to the public (TMI anyone?). And to mitigate this issue perhaps Fitbit should change its privacy defaults.
Fitbit inspires people to exercise more eat better and live
The company is developing an ultra-compact wireless wearable sensor called the Fitbit Tracker that automatically tracks data about a person's activities such as calories burned sleep quality steps and distance.
The Fitbit Tracker collects activity data automatically while it is

Privacy commissioner says Google broke law with ads
Chantal Bernier said shes confident web giant will force advertisers to respect consumers rights after probe.
Canada's interim privacy commissioner says Google has been caught afoul of the law by displaying web ads linked to a person's health history.
Canadas interim privacy commissioner says shes confident Google will force advertisers to respect consumers rights after a probe found the search giants online ad service targeted an individual with health promotions after tracking his activity on the web.
Chantal Bernier named to six-month tenure after the departure of former commissioner Jennifer Stoddart said Google has already implemented some of the recommendations disclosed on the privacy commissioners website Wednesday and will comply in full by June.
European regulators ask Google to clarify privacy policy
She said Google has ended the unlawful tracking activity of an unnamed advertiser whose repeated violations prompted a complaint from an individual who had been searching for sleep apnea aids.
But she acknowledged the commission lacks authority to order compliance or levy fines and other penalties.
Her predecessor had lobbied for legislative updates to reflect challenges in the digital economy arguing that the lack of incentive for companies to obey means the privacy laws are losing relevance.
Stoddart has said the Federal Court should have power to impose significant penalties on companies that violate privacy laws such as the $22.5-million (U.S.) fine over violations Google accepted from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2012.
Bernier has similar views to Stoddarts but said the commission is doing the best we can with what we have.
While naming and shaming companies can be effective at the end of the day they dont have any enforcement powers said Ryerson University professor and cyber law expert Avner Levin.
Ottawa may have been reluctant to toughen privacy laws given Canadians apparent complacency about online privacy threats as suggested in polls he added.
And while the commissioner has the option of taking companies to Federal Court if they refuse to comply with recommendations Levin noted that the avenue can be long expensive and risky.
The privacy ombudsmans recommendations are in response to a complaint from an individual who after searching online for medical devices to treat apnea a condition that affects breathing during sleep was followed by advertisements for the devices as he visited unrelated websites.
We also have concerns about whether other advertising networks are complying with Canadian privacy law Bernier said. We will be contacting various advertising stakeholders in the near future to share these investigation results and remind them of their privacy obligations.
While so-called behavioral advertising is not illegal Canadas privacy laws prohibit advertisers from collecting sensitive personal information such as individuals health information for the purpose of delivering tailored ads.
Googles own privacy policy says when tailored ads are shown the company will not associate a cookie or other identifiers with sensitive categories such as race religion sexual orientation or health.
Google says the problem identified during the investigation relates to remarketing campaigns  which allow an advertiser to target ads to recent visitors to their site. Google acknowledged that some of the advertisers using its ad service do not comply with the corporations policy against interest-based advertising relating to sensitive issues.
The investigation identified shortcomings in Googles monitoring systems. The Privacy Commissioner recommended Google develop a more formalized and rigorous system for reviewing advertisements for policy compliance.
In response to the Privacy Commissioners concerns the Mountain View Calif.-based company committed to:
Provide additional information to advertisers creating remarketing campaigns;
Increase monitoring of remarketing campaigns for possible violations of its policy;
Offer more training to its own staff in addressing potential policy violations; and
Weve worked closely with the office of the privacy commissioner throughout this process and are pleased to be resolving this issue said a Google Canada spokeswoman in a statement.

pri_250_db,50m living social records compromised.txt,"You probably heard about the Target data breach that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of the retail giant's customers into the hands of cybercriminals in late 2013. But Target's security nightmare wasn't the worst data breach in history.
Here are the 10 worst data breaches in history  so far.
Heartland Payment Systems 2008-2009: 130 million records compromised
In early 2009 this Princeton New Jersey-based payment processor announced the largest data breach ever to affect an American company. Heartland's breach exposed information from approximately 130 million credit and debit cards to cybercriminals.
Malware planted on Heartland's network recorded card data as it arrived from retailers. Because the company processed payments for more than 250000 businesses across the country the impact was huge.
In 2010 Albert Gonzalez the convicted mastermind behind the Heartland breach (as well as another huge breach) was sentenced to 20 years in prison  the longest sentence ever handed down for computer crime in a U.S. court.
Target Stores 2013: 110 million records compromised
In December 2013 retail giant Target confirmed that hackers had infected the company's payment-card readers making off with approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers that had been used at Target stores in the United States during the 2013 post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.
In January 2014 Target announced that the contact information  full names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers  of 70 million customers had also been compromised. Some of those customers probably also had credit-card data compromised in the earlier breach but it's possible that as many as 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Sony online entertainment services 2011: 102 million records compromised
In April 2011 attackers whose identities are still unknown targeted the PlayStation Network that links Sony's home gaming consoles as well as Sony Online Entertainment which hosts massively multiplayer online PC games and the Qriocity video- and music-streaming service.
Initially Sony said that only the personal information of 78 million PlayStation Network users  login credentials names addresses phone numbers and email addresses  had been exposed. But the tally of compromised accounts rose by 24.6 million when investigators discovered the attackers had also penetrated SOE and Qriocity. The credit-card data of approximately 23400 SOE users in Europe was also stolen.
Following the initial breach disclosure the PlayStation Network went dark worldwide for more than three weeks. In May 2011 Sony estimated its cleanup costs  which included fighting 65 class-action lawsuits brought against the company  at $171 million.
National Archive and Records Administration 2008: 76 million records compromised
Not all data breaches are the result of criminal activity. In late 2008 a hard drive at the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) stopped working. It held the names contact information and Social Security numbers of 76 million U.S. military veterans.
Instead of being destroyed on-site the drive was sent for repair to a government contractor which determined the drive could not be fixed  so it was sent it out to be scrapped. It is not clear whether the drive was actually destroyed.
Following complaints by an IT manager at NARA an investigation was launched and NARA changed its policies to destroy all malfunctioning storage media containing sensitive personal information.
""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII [personally identifiable information] occurred and therefore does not believe that notification [of the affected veterans] is necessary or appropriate at this time"" the agency told Wired News in 2009.
Anthem 2015: 69 million to 80 million records compromisedIn February 2015 Anthem formerly known as WellPoint and the second-largest health insurer in the U.S. revealed its customer database had been breached. Stolen data included names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers and employment histories  everything an identity thief might need. As many as 80 million current and former customers were thought to be affected.
Epsilon 2011: 60 million to 250 million records compromised
In March 2011 the Texas-based marketing firm Epsilon which handled email communications for more than 2500 clients worldwide  including seven Fortune 10 companies  announced that databases pertaining to about 50 Epsilon clients had been stolen.
Email addresses of at least 60 million customers ended up in the hands of cybercriminals and more than a dozen major retailers banks hotels and other companies were affected including Best Buy JPMorgan Chase Capital One Bank and Verizon.
Epsilon could not confirm exactly how many individuals were affected. Conservative estimates put the number of email addresses stolen at 60 million but according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a San Diego-based nonprofit advocacy group the number may have been as high as 250 million.
Home Depot 2014: 56 million payment cards compromised
In September 2014 hardware and building-supplies warehouse retailer Home Depot admitted what had been suspected for weeks. Beginning in April or May of the same year ""carders"" had infected its point-of-sale systems at stores in the U.S. and Canada with malware that pretended to be antivirus software but instead stole customer credit and debit cards.
The theft may have been the largest haul of payment cards resulting from a direct attack on a retailer if the lower estimate from the TJX breach (see below) is accepted. But unlike the Target theft less than a year earlier the Home Depot theft didn't result in customers staying away nor did it generate quite the same media outcry.
Evernote 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In March 2013 users of the note-taking and archiving service Evernote learned that their email addresses usernames and encrypted passwords had been exposed by a security breach. No financial data was stolen and the company confirmed that none of the user-generated content on its servers had been compromised.
However as had been the case for those affected by Epsilon's 2011 breach Evernote users who had their usernames and email addresses stolen were vulnerable to spam emails and phishing campaigns  some of which pretended to be password-reset emails coming from Evernote itself.
Living Social 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In April 2013 Living Social a daily-deals site partly owned by Amazon announced that the names email addresses birth dates and encrypted passwords of more than 50 million customers worldwide had been stolen by hackers. Twenty million Living Social customers whose information was stored on servers in Asia were not affected.
TJX Companies Inc. 2006-2007: At least 46 million records compromised
When it was discovered in 2007 the TJX data breach was the biggest theft of consumer data ever in the United States affecting the parent company of several major retail brands including Marshalls T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. At least 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period but some estimates put the number at closer to 90 million.
About 450000 TJX customers also had their personally identifiable information stolen including driver's license numbers. The breach ultimately cost the Framingham Massachusetts-based company $256 million.
The TJX hackers included Albert Gonzalez who was cooperating with law-enforcement investigations into earlier data thefts when he took part in both the TJX breach and the even larger Heartland Payment Systems attack two years later.
Honorable mention: Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014: Company's inner workings completely exposed
On Nov. 24 2014 staffers at Sony Pictures Entertainment the movie and television production division of Sony had their computer screens hijacked by a grinning skull. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace said it had taken over the corporate network and would release detailed company information online if unspecified demands weren't met. Within days gigabytes of internal Sony Pictures data appeared on file-sharing sites including Social Security numbers and scanned passports belonging to actors and executives internal passwords unpublished scripts marketing plans financial and legal information and even four entire unreleased Sony movies.
The company's 6800 employees plus an estimated 40000 other individuals the company had paid over previous years were placed at dire risk of identity theft and rival Hollywood studios got a detailed blueprint of Sony Pictures' accounts future plans and internal workings.Some rumors blamed North Korea others disgruntled insiders. Whatever the cause the incident threatened the very survival of Sony Pictures Entertainment as a company and may be the most damaging corporate data breach ever.

It takes the average reader just seven hours to read the final book in Suzanne Collins's ""Hunger Games"" trilogy on the Kobo e-readerabout 57 pages an hour. Nearly 18000 Kindle readers have highlighted the same line from the second book in the series: ""Because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them."" And on Barnes & Noble's Nook the first thing that most readers do upon finishing the first ""Hunger Games"" book is to download the next one.
For centuries reading has largely been a solitary and private act an intimate exchange between the reader and the words on the page. But the rise of digital books has prompted a profound shift in the way we read transforming the activity into something measurable and quasi-public. Eben Shapiro explains on Lunch Break. Photo: AP.
In the past publishers and authors had no way of knowing what happens when a reader sits down with a book. Does the reader quit after three pages or finish it in a single sitting? Do most readers skip over the introduction or read it closely underlining passages and scrawling notes in the margins? Now e-books are providing a glimpse into the story behind the sales figures revealing not only how many people buy particular books but how intensely they read them.

For centuries reading has largely been a solitary and private act an intimate exchange between the reader and the words on the page. But the rise of digital books has prompted a profound shift in the way we read transforming the activity into something measurable and quasi-public.
The major new players in e-book publishingAmazon Apple and Googlecan easily track how far readers are getting in books how long they spend reading them and which search terms they use to find books. Book apps for tablets like the iPad Kindle Fire and Nook record how many times readers open the app and how much time they spend reading. Retailers and some publishers are beginning to sift through the data gaining unprecedented insight into how people engage with books.
Publishing has lagged far behind the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to measuring consumers' tastes and habits. TV producers relentlessly test new shows through focus groups; movie studios run films through a battery of tests and retool them based on viewers' reactions. But in publishing reader satisfaction has largely been gauged by sales data and reviewsmetrics that offer a postmortem measure of success but can't shape or predict a hit. That's beginning to change as publishers and booksellers start to embrace big data and more tech companies turn their sights on publishing.
Barnes & Noble which accounts for 25% to 30% of the e-book market through its Nook e-reader has recently started studying customers' digital reading behavior. Data collected from Nooks reveals for example how far readers get in particular books how quickly they read and how readers of particular genres engage with books.
Jim Hilt the company's vice president of e-books says the company is starting to share their insights with publishers to help them create books that better hold people's attention.
The stakes are high for the company as it seeks a greater share of the e-book market. Sales of Nook devices rose 45% this past fiscal year and e-book sales for the Nook rose 119%. Overall Nook devices and e-books generated $1.3 billion compared with $880 million the previous year. Microsoft recently invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in the Nook. Mr. Hilt says that the company is still in ""the earliest stages of deep analytics"" and is sifting through ""more data than we can use."" But the datawhich focuses on groups of readers not individualshas already yielded some useful insights into how people read particular genres. Some of the findings confirm what retailers already know by glancing at the best-seller lists. For example Nook users who buy the first book in a popular series like ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" or ""Divergent"" a young-adult series by Veronica Roth tend to tear through all the books in the series almost as if they were reading a single novel.
Barnes & Noble has determined through analyzing Nook data that nonfiction books tend to be read in fits and starts while novels are generally read straight through and that nonfiction books particularly long ones tend to get dropped earlier. Science-fiction romance and crime-fiction fans often read more books more quickly than readers of literary fiction do and finish most of the books they start. Readers of literary fiction quit books more often and tend skip around between books.
Those insights are already shaping the types of books that Barnes & Noble sells on its Nook. Mr. Hilt says that when the data showed that Nook readers routinely quit long works of nonfiction the company began looking for ways to engage readers in nonfiction and long-form journalism. They decided to launch ""Nook Snaps"" short works on topics ranging from weight loss and religion to the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Pinpointing the moment when readers get bored could also help publishers create splashier digital editions by adding a video a Web link or other multimedia features Mr. Hilt says. Publishers might be able to determine when interest in a fiction series is flagging if readers who bought and finished the first two books quickly suddenly slow down or quit reading later books in the series. ""The bigger trend we're trying to unearth is where are those drop-offs in certain kinds of books and what can we do with publishers to prevent that?"" Mr. Hilt says. ""If we can help authors create even better books than they create today it's a win for everybody.""
Some authors welcome the prospect. Novelist Scott Turow says he's long been frustrated by the industry's failure to study its customer base. ""I once had an argument with one of my publishers when I said 'I've been publishing with you for a long time and you still don't know who buys my books' and he said 'Well nobody in publishing knows that' "" says Mr. Turow president of the Authors Guild. ""If you can find out that a book is too long and you've got to be more rigorous in cutting personally I'd love to get the information.""
Others worry that a data-driven approach could hinder the kinds of creative risks that produce great literature. ""The thing about a book is that it can be eccentric it can be the length it needs to be and that is something the reader shouldn't have anything to do with"" says
Jonathan Galassi president and publisher of Farrar Straus & Giroux. ""We're not going to shorten 'War and Peace' because someone didn't finish it."" Publishers are only just beginning to mull over the potential uses for e-reading data. Many are skeptical that analytics can aid in the industry's ongoing battle to woo consumers who are increasingly distracted by games and social media. But at a time when traditional publishers are losing ground to tech giants like Amazon and Apple better analytics seem to offer tantalizing possibilities. Amazon in particular has an advantage in this fieldit's both a retailer and a publisher which puts the company in a unique position to use the data it gathers on its customers' reading habits. It's no secret that Amazon and other digital book retailers track and store consumer information detailing what books are purchased and read. Kindle users sign an agreement granting the company permission to store information from the deviceincluding the last page you've read plus your bookmarks highlights notes and annotationsin its data servers.
Amazon can identify which passages of digital books are popular with readers and shares some of this data publicly on its website through features such as its ""most highlighted passages"" list. Readers digitally ""highlight"" selections using a button on the Kindle; they can also opt to see the lines commonly highlighted by other readers as they read a book. Amazon aggregates these selections to see what gets underlined the most. Topping the list is the line from the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy. It is followed by the opening sentence of ""Pride and Prejudice."" ""We think of it as the collective intelligence of all the people reading on Kindle"" says Amazon spokeswoman
Some privacy watchdogs argue that e-book users should be protected from having their digital reading habits recorded. ""There's a societal ideal that what you read is nobody else's business"" says Cindy Cohn legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation a nonprofit group that advocates for consumer rights and privacy. ""Right now there's no way for you to tell Amazon I want to buy your books but I don't want you to track what I'm reading.""
Amazon declined to comment on how it analyzes and uses the Kindle data it gathers. EFF has pressed for legislation to prevent digital book retailers from handing over information about individuals' reading habits as evidence to law enforcement agencies without a court's approval. Earlier this year California instituted the ""reader privacy act"" which makes it more difficult for law-enforcement groups to gain access to consumers' digital reading records. Under the new law agencies must get a court order before they can require digital booksellers to turn over information revealing which books their customers have browsed purchased read and underlined. The American Civil Liberties Union and EFF which partnered with Google and other organizations to push for the legislation are now seeking to enact similar laws in other states. Bruce Schneier a cyber-security expert and author worries that readers may steer clear of digital books on sensitive subjects such as health sexuality and securityincluding his own worksout of fear that their reading is being tracked. ""There are a gazillion things that we read that we want to read in private"" Mr. Schneier says.
There are some 40 million e-readers and 65 million tablets in use in the U.S. according to analysts at Forrester Research. In the first quarter of 2012 e-books generated $282 million in sales compared with $230 million for adult hardcover books the Association of American Publishers recently found. Meanwhile the shift to digital books has fueled an arms race among digital start-ups seeking to cash in on the massive pool of data collected by e-reading devices and reading apps. New e-reading services which allow readers to purchase and store books in a digital library and read them on different devices have some of the most sophisticated reader tracking software. The digital reading platform Copia which has 50000 subscribers collects detailed demographic and reading dataincluding the age gender and school affiliation of people who bought particular titles as well as how many times the books were downloaded opened and readand shares its findings with publishers. Copia aggregates the data so that individual users aren't identifiable and shares that information with publishers that request it.
Kobo which makes digital reading devices and operates an e-reading service that stocks 2.5 million books and has more than eight million users has recently started looking at how readers as a whole engage with particular books and genres. The company tracks how many hours readers spend on particular titles and how far they get. Kobo recently found for example that most readers who started George R.R. Martin's fantasy novel ""A Dance With Dragons"" finished the book and spent an average of 20 hours reading it a relatively fast read for a 1040-page novel.
Some publishers are already beginning to market test books digitally before releasing a print edition. Earlier this year Sourcebooks which publishes 250 titles a year began experimenting with a new model of serial online publishing. Sourcebooks has released early online editions for half a dozen titles ranging from romance to young adult to nonfiction books and has solicited questions and suggestions from readers. Eventually readers' feedback will be incorporated into the print version.
Scholastic which publishes popular young-adult fiction such as Harry Potter and ""The Hunger Games"" created online message boards and interactive games connected to its popular series ""39 Clues."" The online game and message board which has 1.9 million registered users allows the publisher to track which story lines and characters are resonating with young readers. David Levithan Scholastic's publisher and editorial director says the online feedback has shaped the ongoing ""39 Clues"" series and helped to turn it into a global franchise with more than 15 million copies in print. ""You very rarely get a glimpse into the reader's mind"" he says. ""With a printed book there's no such thing as an analytic. You can't tell which pages are dog-eared.""
Few publishers have taken the experiment as far as Coliloquy a digital publishing company that was created earlier this year by
Waynn Lue a computer scientist and former Google engineer and
Lisa Rutherford a venture capitalist and former president of Twofish a gaming-analytics firm.
Coliloquy's digital books which are available on Kindle Nook and Android e-readers have a ""choose-your-own-adventure""-style format allowing readers to customize characters and plot lines. The company's engineers aggregate and pool the data gleaned from readers' selections and send it to the authors who can adjust story lines in their next books to reflect popular choices.
""Data and analytics we've seen how it revolutionized certain industries like mobile apps and gaming"" says Mr. Lue. ""With reading we don't yet have that engagement data and we wanted to provide a feedback mechanism that didn't exist before between authors and readers."" Coliloquy developed its software through Amazon's Kindle data developer program which allows outside companies to create interactive content for Kindle. Their proprietary data platform draws on complex algorithms similar to gaming software that lets readers choose from different narrative pathways.
The company hired six editors and five technology and product developers and began recruiting authors from a range of genres including romance nonfiction young-adult fantasy and erotica. Since launching this past January the company has released eight titles and is expanding into crime fiction legal thrillers and experimental fiction. Mr. Lue and Ms. Rutherford declined to provide sales figures for Coliloquy's titles citing a nondisclosure agreement with Amazon. But they say more than 90% of readers who buy Colloquy's books which range from $2.99 to $7.99 finish reading them and 67% reread the books.
In ""Parish Mail"" Kira Snyder's young adult mystery series set in New Orleans readers can decide whether the teenage protagonist solves crimes by using magic or by teaming up with a police detective's cute teenage son. Readers of ""Great Escapes"" an erotic romance series co-written by Linda Wisdom and Lynda K. Scott can customize the hero's appearance and the intensity of the love scenes. A recent report from Coliloquy showed that the ideal hero for ""Great Escapes"" readers is tall with black hair and green eyes a rugged burly build and a moderately but not overly hairy chest.
In Tawna Fenske's romantic caper ""Getting Dumped""which centers on a young woman who finds work at a landfill after getting laid off from her high-profile job at the county's public relations officereaders can choose which of three suitors they want the heroine to pursue. The most recent batch of statistics showed that 53.3% chose Collin a Hugh Grant type; 16.8% chose Pete the handsome but unavailable co-worker; and 29.7% of readers liked Daniel the heroine's emotionally distant boyfriend. Ms. Fenske originally planned to get rid of Daniel by sending him to prison and writing him out of the series. Then she saw the statistics. She decided 29.7% was too big a chunk of her audience to ignore.
""So much of the time it's an editor and agent and publisher telling you 'This is what readers want' but this is hands-on reader data"" says Ms. Fenske 37 who lives in Bend Ore. ""I've always wondered did that person buy it and stop after the first three pages? Now I can see they bought it and read it in the first week.""
In the first quarter of 2012 e-books generated $282 million in sales compared with $230 million for adult hardcover books according to the Association of American Publishers. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said sales of print books overall were $230 million in the quarter.

Checkout counters at a Target store in 2008. Credit: Marlith/Creative Commons
UPDATED Jan. 19 with information about KAPTOXA and its possible creator. Updated Jan. 31 with information on the penetration of Target's network and a possible tie to the Neiman Marcus breach.
Over the past month the Target data breach initially disclosed in December which affected 40 million credit and debit cards has been widened to include 70 million more Target customers.
Meanwhile department store Neiman Marcus has disclosed that it was also recently hit with a breach that included an unspecified number of stolen credit cards and reports say at least three more retailers as yet unnamed were also affected by similar thefts of customer credit cards.
We don't have anything close to the whole story but so far here's what we know or can reasonably guess.
A data breach is when an organization that's been entrusted with sensitive data loses control of that data. A breach doesn't necessarily involve theft; some data breaches occur when hard drives or spools of tape get lost during transport.
Beginning Nov. 29 2013 or ""Black Friday"" the start of the post-Thanksgiving U.S. shopping season an unknown group or groups of hackers penetrated or infected at least two Target computer systems. That intrusion continued until Dec. 15 when Target discovered the penetration and shut it down.
At around the same time another attack infected or penetrated a Neiman Marcus computer system that processed credit- and debit-card transactions. (Update: The New York Times has heard from unnamed sources who said the Neiman Marcus breach may have begun in July 2013.)
At least three other U.S. retailers as yet unnamed were also affected. It's possible there were many more.
How many people were affected by these data breaches?
Right now we don't know because other than Target the affected retailers are not telling us.
Following a report by security blogger Brian Krebs Target disclosed on Dec. 18 2013 that approximately 40 million credit and debit cards used at Target retail stores in the U.S. were affected but not credit cards used in Canadian stores or on the Target retail websites for either country. Target Australia is a different company and was also unaffected.
On Jan. 10 2014 Target disclosed that personal information pertaining to 70 million Target customers was also compromised. This information seems to have come from a separate set of data than the credit-card data. There are probably many individuals whose information appears in both data sets but it's theoretically possible that 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Also on Jan. 10 Neiman Marcus disclosed to Krebs that an unspecified number of credit cards used at its stores had been affected by a data breach similar to Target's initial breach.
On Jan. 12 Reuters reported that according to its unnamed sources in law enforcement and the financial industry three more U.S. retailers had been hit in similar breaches during the 2013 holiday shopping season.
So far there have been two kinds of information compromised.
The first kind is credit- and debit-card data of the kind found on the magnetic stripes on the back of the cards plus the four-digit personal identification numbers (PINs) of debit cards which are not on the magnetic stripes.
Magnetic-stripe data known as ""track data"" replicates some of the information printed on the front of the card including cardholder name card number and expiration date. Track data does not include the CVV2 or ""card not present"" verification number that websites often demand of online shoppers.
Debit-card PINs are not stored on the cards. The fact that the Target thieves were able to steal PINs  in heavily encrypted form according to Target  indicates that Target's point-of-sale payment system which transmits PINs upstream to centralized servers as customers type them in was successfully attacked.
Neiman Marcus has also disclosed that credit-card information was stolen in its data breach but has given no further details.
The second kind of data taken from Target was personally identifiable information which in this case consisted of the names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers for 70 million individuals. Such information is typically found in a customer-loyalty or frequent-shopper program.
Target has said that no Social Security numbers or dates of birth were compromised and that credit- and debit-card information was not part of the second data set.
(Update: In a private notification to retailers Jan. 17 about point-of-sale malware the FBI said ""an inordinate amount of premier high-limit credit accounts"" were among a batch of stolen cards posted to cybercrime online forums on Jan. 4. The FBI did not identify the source of the cards but the timing implies a connection to the Neiman Marcus breach.)
Reuters' sources say online criminals from Eastern Europe are behind the two disclosed and three rumored data breaches. There's been no independent confirmation of that claim.
Eastern European online criminals are very active but Americans led the group of hackers who carried out the biggest data breaches ever which affected TJX Corporation and Heartland Payment Systems in 2007 and 2009 respectively.
Credit- and debit-card account information has some value in online criminal marketplaces though prices vary widely according to the type of card stolen the credit limit on the card and the geographical location of the legitimate cardholder.
An unusual number of high-limit cards such as American Express platinum or black cards were among those believed to have been stolen from Neiman Marcus.
Full track data plus PINs would enable the original thieves to sell the account data to street-level criminals who would use the track data to ""clone"" cards by copying the track data to blanks. The blanks could then be ""busted out"" racking up many purchases in a few hours before the card was blocked by the legitimate card issuer.
Personally identifiable information of the sort stolen in the second Target breach could be used to steal identities though the addition of Social Security numbers or dates of birth would have made that data more valuable. Stolen identities can be used to fraudulently open bank accounts secure loans or obtain identification documents such as drivers' licenses.
(Update: Krebs' sources told him the attackers may have gotten into Target's computer network through a compromised Web server and from there infiltrated the network connecting point-of-sale terminals in Target stores across the United States. Israeli security firm Seculert said the stolen information was first collected on a compromised server within Target's network then sent several days later to another server in Russia.)
(Update: On Jan. 29 Target said ""the intruder stole a vendor's credentials which were used to access our system."" The Wall Street Journal's sources told it Target had tightened up access to two entry points one used by staffers to access human-resources records and the other used by outside vendors.On the same day Krebs reported that the intruders may have leveraged server-management software for which default administrative logins had not been changed after implementation.)
On Jan. 12 Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel told CNBC that ""malware in the access point""  the point-of-sale terminals at checkout counters into which customers swipe credit and debit cards  was involved. There are several strains of malware that infect point-of-sale terminals but Target has not provided more specific details.
In its Jan. 12 story Reuters reported that its sources said there were several common features among the data breaches at Target Neiman Marcus and the three undisclosed retailers. Among the common features was the use of ""RAM scraping"" a little-known technique that captures data while it is in a computer's working memory before it is encrypted for storage or transmission.
Because two different sets of data were taken from Target it's likely that the attackers were able to move freely around Target's internal computer network after their initial network penetration.
Other than that the public doesn't know how the attackers got into any of the affected retailers' systems. Some security experts initially speculated that the Target breaches were the result of an inside job but if five or more retailers indeed were hit in the same wave of attacks it's more likely that the attackers found a common vulnerability in the retailers' systems through which they were able to insert malware.
The fact that so many Target stores were affected implies that the infection took place on a centralized payment-processing system and was then distributed out through the network to Target retail stores in the United States. It's noteworthy that Target Canada an independent subsidiary was not affected.
KAPTOXA pronounced ""kar-toe-sha"" or ""kar-toe-kha"" is a Russian slang term for ""potato"" akin to ""spud"" or ""tater."" (The proper Russian word is ""kartofel."") Experts on cybercrime say ""kartosha"" is sometimes used to describe a stolen credit card.
Dallas security firm iSight Partners used the word ""kartosha"" in a Jan. 16 report posted on the firm's website but since taken down to describe a credit-card-stealing Trojan (a type of malware) that was infecting point-of-sale systems at unnamed retailers.
The malware that hit Target is thought by many experts to be a derivation of BlackPOS a RAM-scraping Trojan active since March 2013. In its redacted report iSight Partners said Kartosha was BlackPOS modified to avoid detection by anti-virus software.
iSight Partners also calls the Target malware POSRAM; Symantec calls it Reedum. ""Kartoxa"" turns up in a May 2013 report on BlackPOS by a French security blogger calling himself Steven K.
Russian malicious hackers using the pseudonyms ""Antkiller"" ""ree4"" and ""Wagner Richard"" have been named by different experts as the creator of BlackPOS. It's not clear whether they are the same person.
Media reports based on a press statement by IntelCrawler a small security company in Los Angeles have named a Russian 17-year-old as the author; Krebs disputes that identification and says IntelCrawler has fingered the wrong guy.
It's unlikely that Antkiller/ree4 who was selling copies of BlackPOS in cybercrime chat rooms for about $2000 in the spring of 2013 is the actual Target hacker.
Krebs thinks a Ukrainian cybercriminal associated with the online-crime website Rescator may be among the Target hackers or may know who they are.
(Update: In its private notification to retailers Jan. 17 the FBI said KAPTOXA had first been spotted in 2011 but that the most recent variant had been modified to evade signature detection against the older version.)
Target is attempting to contact all affected customers for which it has an email address. Neiman Marcus said it is doing the same. In addition some banks are independently notifying their own customers whose cards were involved in the first Target breach and JPMorgan Chase went so far as to replace the debit cards of its affected customers.
If you shopped at a Target or Neiman Marcus store during the 2013 holiday shopping season contact your bank or credit-card issuer and alert the company that you may be affected. Ask for a list of recent card transactions and examine the transactions for anything that seems fishy.
As stated above anyone who shopped at a Target or Neiman Marcus store during the 2013 holiday shopping season should alert his or her bank or card issuer and also examine all recent transactions for suspicious activity. The bank or card issuer should be able to provide an up-to-date activity record including transactions that occurred after the latest monthly statement.
If you have a debit card that may have been affected in the Target or Neiman Marcus breaches change your card's PIN. It's probably not necessary to ask your bank or card issuer for a new card since you won't be liable for any fraudulent charges but it couldn't hurt. If your card is indeed on the list of compromised cards your bank has almost certainly taken steps to prevent its fraudulent use.
If you have a Target REDcard or other Target customer-loyalty or frequent-shopper card you may be among the 70 million people whose personally identifiable information was compromised in the second Target breach. (This is true whether or not you shopped at a Target store during the 2013 holiday season.) If so you're at a heightened risk of identity theft.
Target is offering a year of free credit monitoring for anyone who feels they may have been involved in either Target breach and is signing people up at creditmonitoring.target.com.
Credit monitoring will alert you immediately if there is suspicious financial activity involving your name such as someone trying to open a bank account while posing as you.
Is there any way I can prevent this from happening again?
Not really unless you stop using credit cards entirely. It's up to the retailers to protect card transactions and by some accounts Target had pretty good corporate data security. In the U.S. cardholders are almost never liable for fraudulent transactions as long as they report stolen cards and suspicious activity in a timely manner.
Some experts recommend against enrolling in retailer customer-loyalty programs partly because unnecessary distribution of personal information increases the chances that it can be compromised in data breaches such as the second Target breach.
How could Target or Neiman Marcus have prevented this from happening?
Without knowing exactly how the attackers got in we can only speculate on what might have prevented the intrusions. Because more than one retailer was affected it's possible that a spear-phishing campaign was used to infect corporate networks through emails sent to company employees in which case phishing-awareness campaigns might have prevented the breaches.
However assuming that the five companies involved had different methods and protocols of network security it's also possible that the criminals figured out a way into the networks that no one had thought of before in which case nothing would have prevented the initial penetration.
Security experts recommend that corporate networks be strictly controlled so that intruders have limited movement within the network once they're inside. It's not clear what kind of internal controls Target and Neiman Marcus had.
The public doesn't know and may never know. Data breaches often go unreported and with good reason  following the disclosure of its first data breach a week before Christmas Target's sales substantially dropped off. Both breaches will cost Target tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits reimburse banks and implement new security systems.
There are laws that require at least partial disclosure to affected customers in many states but enforcement is haphazard. Federal laws on breach disclosures cover only the health and financial industries.
Publicly traded companies are required to disclose anything that affects business performance in quarterly shareholder statements but data breach cleanups can be masked with euphemisms or lumped together with other unspecified expenses.

pri_250_db,microsoft reviews user emails as part of an invest.txt,"Microsoft took a lot of criticism last week after it was revealed that the company looked at the email content of a customer in the course of tracking down someone suspected of stealing trade secrets from the company.
The company said then that its own terms of service allow it to carry out such an examination under exceptional circumstances.
Now Microsoft is changing its policy saying that in such circumstances it will call in law enforcement to inspect a customers content rather than doing so itself.
Brad Smith Microsofts general counsel wrote in a blog post Friday: Effective immediately if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property from Microsoft we will not inspect a customers private content ourselves. Instead we will refer the matter to law enforcement if further action is required.

$1 for 4 weeks.The change will also be incorporated into Microsofts terms of service in the coming months Smith wrote.
The policy change stems from a case in which former Microsoft employee Alex Kibkalo was accused of stealing trade secrets.
Kibkalo a former Microsoft software architect who worked for the company in Lebanon was arrested March 19
in Bellevue. He is charged with stealing trade secrets related to pre-release software updates for Windows 8 and Microsofts Activation Server Software Development Kit and giving that information to an unidentified tech blogger in France.
Microsoft found out about Kibkalo after searching the bloggers Hotmail account.
The blogger who had previously posted comments about internal Microsoft build specifications for unreleased software was someone Microsoft had been tracking even before the Kibkalo leak according to the complaint filed by federal prosecutors.
That blogger had apparently contacted an outside source using Hotmail and sent the source the proprietary Microsoft code according to the complaint which goes on to say that the outside source then contacted Microsoft.
Microsofts Office of Legal Compliance then approved content pulls of the bloggers Hotmail account.
Microsoft said last week that a court order was not needed to do so and in any case it wouldnt have been able to get one because courts do not issue orders authorizing someone to search themselves according to a blog post from John Frank Microsofts deputy general counsel.
The company did however put into place some new policies including proceeding with such searches only after an outside attorney who is a former federal judge deems theres sufficient evidence to justify a court order.
policy change goes further in that Microsoft says it now will not conduct such searches itself. Instead it will refer such cases to law enforcement  something that digital civil-rights organizations such as Electronic Frontier Foundation had advocated.
After the revelations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden about the U.S. governments national-surveillance programs and tech companies involvement Microsoft and other companies have been pushing the U.S. government for more transparency and reliance on legal processes to conduct its searches.
Weve advocated that governments should rely on formal legal processes and the rule of law for surveillance activities
Smith said. While our own search was clearly within our legal rights it seems apparent that we should apply a similar principle and rely on formal legal processes for our own investigations involving people who we suspect are stealing from us.

Technology|Jobs Says Apple Made Mistakes With iPhone Data
SAN FRANCISCO  Hoping to put to rest a growing controversy over privacy Steven P. Jobs Apples chief executive took the unusual step of personally explaining that while Apple had made mistakes in how it handled location data on its mobile devices it had not used the iPhone and iPad to keep tabs on the whereabouts of its customers.
We havent been tracking anybody Mr. Jobs said in an interview on Wednesday. Never have. Never will.Mr. Jobs said that Apple would fix the mistakes in a free software update that it would release in the next few weeks.
Mr. Jobs who is currently on medical leave addressed the issue along with two Apple executives  Philip W. Schiller the senior vice president of worldwide product marketing and Scott Forstall the senior vice president of iPhone software. A week ago two researchers reported that they had discovered a file in Apples devices containing what appeared to be data of the locations visited by users over the previous 12 months. The discovery raised fears that Apple was tracking its users and prompted investigations by various European governments and demands for explanations from United States lawmakers.
Steven P. Jobs said that Apple was locating Wi-Fi and cell towers not users but would curb the practice and shorten storage time.
Earlier on Wednesday Apple posted a statement on its Web site explaining how its system used the file to pinpoint a phones location.Mr. Jobs defended the timing of Apples response to the controversy saying that rather than run to the P.R. department it set out to determine exactly what happened.The first thing we always do when a problem is brought to us is we try to isolate it and find out if it is real he said. It took us about a week to do an investigation and write a response which is fairly quick for something this technically complicated.He added Scott and Phil and myself were all involved in writing the response because we think it is that important.Some privacy advocates who were harshly critical of Apple last week praised the companys response saying it was a step in the right direction.Apple acknowledged a mistake and they fixed it Marc Rotenberg executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said in an interview. Thats a good thing.Confirming speculation from some security researchers Apple said in the statement posted on its Web site that the file in peoples iPhones was not a log of their locations but rather the locations of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers surrounding the iPhones location which can be more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.
Apple said it used the data which it called a cache to calculate a devices location more quickly than through GPS satellites.But Apple acknowledged that it had made mistakes which it attributed to programming errors in storing the data for a long time keeping the file unencrypted and storing the data even when users had chosen to turn off location services.The system is incredibly complex Mr. Forstall said. We test this carefully but in such a complex system there are sometimes places where we could do better.
Apple said it would reduce the location cache on the iPhone to no more than seven days. The company also said it would stop backing up the cache onto peoples computers and would delete the cache entirely when users turned off location services.
Apple also said that it updated its database of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers by using its customers phones as sensors. But it said that it could not locate users based on the file on the phone and that it collected the information in an anonymous and encrypted form. The company cannot identify the phone user from the data it said.While some security experts have known about the existence of the file for some time the issue made headlines last week after the researchers reported their findings at a technology conference in San Francisco. Apple came under heavy criticism for its silence after the discovery.The location report attracted attention from some government officials including Senator Al Franken Democrat of Minnesota who sent a stern letter to Apple asking why it was secretly compiling the data and what it would be used for. Congressman Edward Markey a Democrat from Massachusetts and Lisa Madigan the Illinois attorney general also sent letters to Apple asking for an explanation of the issue.
Google acknowledged last week that it too collected data about the location of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers from its users.Apples statement contained a tidbit about possible future product plans. The company said it also was collecting traffic data from its phones and tablets to build a crowd-sourced traffic database. That would enable Apple to provide real-time traffic information along with navigation advice. Google already uses Android phones to collect real-time traffic information.Mr. Jobs declined to answer questions about his health or about any plans to return to Apple. Last week during the companys quarterly financial report Timothy D. Cook the chief operating officer said He continues to be involved in major strategic decisions and I know he wants to be back full time.
A version of this article appears in print on April 28 2011 on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Jobs Concedes Apples Mistakes and Promises a Fix on Location Data Practice.

pri_250_db,some android phones found to be broadcasting locat.txt,"Is Your Android Device Telling the World Where You've Been? | Electronic Frontier Foundation
Is Your Android Device Telling the World Where You've Been?
Do you own an Android device? Is it less than three years old? If so then when your phones screen is off and its not connected to a Wi-Fi network there's a high risk that it is broadcasting your location history to anyone within Wi-Fi range that wants to listen.
This location history comes in the form of the names of wireless networks your phone has previously connected to. These frequently identify places you've been including homes (Toms Wi-Fi) workplaces (Company XYZ office net) churches and political offices (County Party HQ) small businesses (Toulouse Lautrec's house of ill-repute) and travel destinations (Tehran Airport wifi). This data is arguably more dangerous than that leaked in previous location data scandalsbecause it clearly denotes in human language places that you've spent enough time to use the Wi-Fi.1 Normally eavesdroppers would need to spend some effort extracting this sort of information from the latititude/longitude history typically discussed in location privacy analysis. But even when networks seem less identifiable there are ways to look them up.
We briefly mentioned this problem during our recent post about Apple deciding to randomize MAC addresses in iOS 8. As we pointed out there Wi-Fi devices that are not actively connected to a network can send out messages that contain the names of networks theyve joined in the past in an effort to speed up the connection process.2 But after writing that post we became curious just how many phones actually exhibited that behavior and if so how much information they leaked. To our dismay we discovered that many of the modern Android phones we tested leaked the names of the networks stored in their settings (up to a limit of fifteen). And when we looked at these network lists we realized that they were in fact dangerously precise location histories.
Aside from Android some other platforms also suffer from this problem and will need to be fixed although for various reasons Android devices appear to pose the greatest privacy risk at the moment.3
In Android we traced this behavior to a feature introduced in Honeycomb (Android 3.1) called Preferred Network Offload (PNO).4 PNO is supposed to allow phones and tablets to establish and maintain Wi-Fi connections even when theyre in low-power mode (i.e. when the screen is turned off). The goal is to extend battery life and reduce mobile data usage since Wi-Fi uses less power than cellular data. But for some reason even though none of the Android phones we tested broadcast the names of networks they knew about when their screens were on manyof the phones running Honeycomb or later (and even one running Gingerbread) broadcast the names of networks they knew about when their screens were turned off.5
When we brought this issue to Googles attention they responded that:
""We take the security of our users' location data very seriously and we're always happy to be made aware of potential issues ahead of time. Since changes to this behavior would potentially affect user connectivity to hidden access points we are still investigating what changes are appropriate for a future release.""
Additionally yesterday a Google employee submitted a patch to wpa_supplicant which fixes this issue. While we are glad this problem is being addressed so quickly it will still be some time before that fix gets integrated into the downstream Android code. And even then Android fragmentation and the broken update process for non-Google Android devices could delay or even prevent many users from receiving the fix. (We hope Google can make progress on this problem too.)
With that said a workaround is available (for most devices) for users who want to protect their privacy right now: go into your phones Advanced Wi-Fi settings and set the Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep option to Never. Unfortunately this will cause a moderate increase in data usage and power consumptionsomething users shouldnt have to do in order to keep their phone from telling everyone everywhere theyve been.
Unfortunately on at least one device we testeda Motorola Droid 4 running Android 4.1.2even this wasnt sufficient. On the Droid 4 and perhaps on other phones the only practical way to prevent the phone from leaking location is to manually forget the networks you don't want broadcast or disable Wi-Fi entirely whenever you aren't actively connecting to a known Wi-Fi network.6 You can also find apps that will do this automatically for you.
Location history is extremely sensitive information. We urge Google to ship their fix as soon as possible and other Android distributors to offer prompt updates containing it.
1. It can also be used to infer social links between device owners especially when it comes to secure networks with unique names.
2. This capability is also necessary in order to connect to hidden networks because those networks dont broadcast their existence like normal Wi-Fi networks. Instead the phone or other device has to send out a message essentially asking Are you there? and if the hidden network is nearby it will respond.
3. In our testing no iOS 6 or 7 devices were affected though we observed the same problem on one of several tested iOS 5 devices (an iPad) and earlier versions of iOS might or might not be affected. Many laptops are affected including all OS X laptops and many Windows 7 laptops. Desktop OSes will need to be fixed but because our laptops are not usually awake and scanning for networks as we walk around locational history extraction from them requires considerably more luck or targeting.
4. The offending code is actually in an open source project called wpa_supplicant which many Linux distributions including Android use to manage Wi-Fi. We want to give credit to Android developer Chainfireas well as several others on the XDA forums whose posts onthis behaviorwere very informative. A couple of other researchers have previously critiqued this behavior.
5. The list of phones we tested is available as a CSV file or a Google Doc.
6. Note that this method isnt foolproof since an attacker might still be able to get your phone to transmit its known network list when it is connected by transmitting a packet that temporarily disconnects you. Then depending on the timing your phone may send the list of networks before it reconnects.

Botched database leaks records for 191 million voters
If you've voted in the US since 2000 there's a chance your personal info is out in the wild.
Did you vote in a US election sometime this century?
Researcher Chris Vickery has discovered that a badly configured database exposed the voter registration info for 191 million Americans including addresses party affiliations and state voter IDs.
It's not clear who originally managed the data but Vickery and Databreaches.net are reaching out to everyone from online services to Congressional political action committees.
The two are also contacting law enforcement in hopes of shutting down the leak although it's not certain that officials are taking action.
The consequences of this database falling into the wrong hands could be severe as you might have guessed.
Less-than-scrupulous marketers and political campaigns could exploit the data and criminals could combine it with other info to commit fraud or theft.
It's a particularly big problem for people who need to keep their details secret such as stalking victims and police.
Beyond this the leak illustrates the need for stricter consistent security standards around voter data -- while states like California and South Dakota have sharp limits on where records go and what they're used for other states (including Alaska Arkansas and Colorado) have no real restrictions.
There's a real possibility that this kind of incident could happen again.[Image credit: Getty Images]

pri_250_db,nude snapchat images put online by hackers..txt,"Nude 'Snapchat images' put online by hackers - BBC News
Snapchat messages are meant to ""disappear"" after a short time
Explicit images believed to have been sent through messaging service Snapchat were reportedly put online with threats from hackers to upload more.Users who had been accessing the service via a third-party app and not the official Snapchat app had their images intercepted.As half of its users are aged between 13 and 17 there is concern that many of the images may be of children.Snapchat said its servers ""were never breached"".The company added: ""Snapchatters were victimised by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users' security.
""We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed.""However security researchers said Snapchat had to take more responsibility over user data.""For them to just turn round and say 'It's the users' fault' does seem harsh"" said Mark James a security specialist from ESET.
""They give the perception it is safe they need to make it safe. They need to crack down on people's ability to access their data.""The images were uploaded to the internet with a download link shared on a message board on Thursday night according to reports.The download has since gone offline but hackers threatened to post thousands more images. However some doubted the authenticity of the images suggesting many of them were duplicates or ""fake"".Troubling incidentSnapchat is a messaging app that allows the sharing of videos and images that ""disappear"" after a short period of time usually just a few seconds.But according to Business Insider reporter James Cook hackers had boasted of having access to 13 gigabytes' (GB) worth of pictures that had been intercepted over a number of years.Speculation as to the source of the leak has pointed towards two third-party unauthorised services that offered the ability to save Snapchat messages permanently. It suspected that at least one such service was keeping a database of all the pictures and videos that had passed through it.The leak is yet another troubling security and privacy incident for Snapchat said security consultant Brian Honan.At the start of this year 4.6m usernames and phone numbers were leaked online. More recently the service has been suffering from spam messages being sent out from users' accounts without their knowledge.""Has Snapchat been breached? According to the letter of the law no"" said Mr Honan. ""But people use Snapchat to keep their information secure and would expect the company to have systems and services in place to support that.""

Users reported that messages sent via Google's chat features were going to the wrong recipients Thursday.
Google's chat features went haywire Thursday routing some users messages to the wrong recipients.

After receiving reports about a Google glitch the Internet search giant said it was working on the problem and its services ""are gradually returning to normal.

We will update when full service is restored Google later said on its Service Status Dashboard page.

The Internet brand didn't immediately explain the reason for the defect in its messaging platform but the bug appears to be messing with folks who use Google Talk and are trying to communicate with those using the upgraded Google Hangout TechCrunch reported.

Those affected are venting online about the messaging mix up  with some saying it is compromising their privacy and creating a terrifying situation.


Privacy remains a touchy subject for Google which earlier this year agreed to settle with 38 states which sued after the companys Street View mapping cars were found to have collected peoples personal data.

Technology|Twitter Ordered to Yield Data in WikiLeaks Case
SAN FRANCISCO  A federal judge on Thursday ruled that Twitter the popular microblogging platform must reveal information about three of its account holders who are under investigation for their possible links to the WikiLeaks whistle-blower site.The case has become a flash point for online privacy and speech in part because the Justice Department sought the information without a search warrant last year. Instead on the basis of a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act the government demanded that Twitter provide the Internet protocol addresses of three of its users among other things. An Internet protocol address identifies and gives the location of a computer used to log onto the Internet.The three people came to the Justice Departments attention because it believed they were associated with WikiLeaks.
Twitter informed the three people  Jacob Appelbaum an American computer security expert along with Rop Gonggrijp a Dutch citizen and Birgitta Jonsdottir a member of Icelands Parliament  of the governments demand for information earlier this year.The petitioners argued in federal court that their Internet protocol addresses should be considered private information and that the demand for information was too broad and unrelated to WikiLeaks. They also argued that the order suppressed their right to free speech.The court disagreed. Judge Liam OGrady from the United States District Court in Alexandria Va. wrote in his opinion that the information sought was clearly material to establishing key facts related to an ongoing investigation and would have assisted a grand jury in conducting an inquiry into the particular matters under investigation.The judge said that because Twitter users voluntarily turned over the Internet protocol addresses when they signed up for an account they relinquished an expectation of privacy.Petitioners knew or should have known that their I.P. information was subject to examination by Twitter so they had a lessened expectation of privacy in that information particularly in light of their apparent consent to the Twitter terms of service and privacy policy Judge OGrady wrote.The court also dismissed a petition to unseal the Justice Departments explanation for why it sought the account information.Neither the Justice Department nor Twitter company officials responded to e-mail and telephone requests for comment.The petitioners themselves spoke up on Twitter. I would do it again Ms. Jonsdottir posted.Today is one of those losing faith in the justice system kind of days Mr. Appelbaum wrote on Twitter.Lawyers for one of the petitioners said they were still reviewing the judges order and could not yet say what the next steps were.

pri_250_db,callisto service allows victims of sexual assault .txt,"The War on Campus Sexual Assault Goes Digital - The New York Times

Technology|The War on Campus Sexual Assault Goes Digital
Jessica Ladd founder and chief executive of Sexual Health Innovations whose Callisto service lets college students anonymously record details of sexual assaults and report them later. She came up with the idea after she was assaulted as an undergraduate.
As the problem of sexual assault on college campuses has become a hot-button issue for school administrators and federal education regulators one question keeps coming up: Why dont more students report attacks?
According to a recent study of 27 schools about one-quarter of female undergraduates and students who identified as queer or transgender said they had experienced nonconsensual sex or touching since entering college but most of the students said they did not report it to school officials or support services.Some felt the incidents werent serious enough. Others said they did not think anyone would believe them or they feared negative social consequences. Some felt it would be too emotionally difficult.Now in an effort to give students additional options  and to provide schools with more concrete data  a nonprofit software start-up in San Francisco called Sexual Health Innovations has developed an online reporting system for campus sexual violence.Students at participating colleges can use its site called Callisto to record details of an assault anonymously. The site saves and time-stamps those records. That allows students to decide later whether they want to formally file reports with their schools  identifying themselves by their school-issued email addresses  or download their information and take it directly to the police. The site also offers a matching system in which a user can elect to file a report with the school electronically only if someone else names the same assailant.Callistos hypothesis is that some college students  who already socialize study and shop online  will be more likely initially to document a sexual assault on a third-party site than to report it to school officials on the phone or in person.If you have to walk into a building to report you can only go at certain times of day and youre not certain who you have to talk to how many people you have to talk to what they will ask Jessica Ladd the nonprofits founder and chief executive said in a recent interview in New York. Whereas online you can fill out a form at any time of day or night from anywhere and push a button.
Callisto is part of a wave of apps and sites that tackle different facets of the sexual assault problem on campus. Some colleges and universities have introduced third-party mobile apps that enable students to see maps of local crime hot spots report suspicious activity request a ride from campus security services or allow their friends to track their movements virtually as they walk home. Many schools now ask students to participate in online or in-person training programs that present different situations involving sexual assault relationship violence and issues of consent.Institutions of higher learning are increasingly starting such programs to comply with statutes like Title IX the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by education programs that receive federal funding. Much of that activity comes in response to a letter issued in 2011 by the Department of Education that said colleges must create campuses free of sexual violence or face possible penalties. Schools are also trying to manage the reputational risks posed by students who accuse administrators of mishandling their sexual assault cases. As of Nov. 4 the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights was investigating 175 cases involving sexual violence at 146 postsecondary schools.
Some of the emerging tools seem like digital updates of blue light poles the campus phone stations that college students have used for years to summon help or report an emergency  often after a problem has already occurred.But Callisto presents itself as a more advanced reporting system that is particularly sensitive to students experiencing trauma. Ms. Ladd said she came up with the idea for a web-based reporting system after she was assaulted as an undergraduate at Pomona College in Claremont Calif.I went through the reporting process and found it disempowering and retraumatizing she said. I started thinking about what would have been helpful.So far the site has raised nearly $400000 from Google.org Googles philanthropic arm and other donors. This semester two schools  Pomona College and the University of San Francisco  are testing Callisto. And a handful of students at the University of San Francisco have already used the site to file reports to school authorities.But even if students choose not to officially submit their information the site plans to share aggregated data to help administrators identify patterns and trends that could inform their prevention efforts.I think it could be helpful to see if there are reports on specific dates if there are reports after certain events in San Francisco or on campus says Julie Orio the interim vice provost of student life at the University of San Francisco.The site also illustrates some challenges that start-ups may face in trying to apply insights from consumer behavior to entrenched societal problems.One of Callistos features is its matching system  in which a student can ask the site to store information about an assault in escrow and forward it to the school only if someone else reports another attack identifying the same assailant. The point is not just to discover possible repeat offenders. In college communities where many survivors of sexual assault know their assailants the idea of the information escrow is to reduce students fears that the first person to make an accusation could face undue repercussions.Ms. Ladd says students may be more motivated to come forward if they can help out other survivors.It means that someone is a threat to my community and not just me she says.At least in its initial incarnation however the matching function has potential drawbacks. At one school testing Callisto for example the site asks students to submit just one piece of identifying information to match their attackers: a link to the assailants Facebook page. That protocol sends students who have just experienced sexual assault to Facebook accounts where they are likely to see photos of their attacker  and the friends they might have in common.That almost builds in a deterrent to reporting says Keith Hiatt the director of the technology program at the Human Rights Center at the University of California Berkeley School of Law. You start to envision the consequences that could arise from reporting.Ms. Ladd said she and her team had consulted with sexual assault survivors during the sites development process and they did not find the Facebook identifier problematic. She added that the team worked with college administrators to determine the matching identifier like a school email address that would work best for their campus.The larger issue here is that in acknowledging a culture in which people who consider filing sexual assault reports reasonably fear they will not be believed the Callisto matching function may inadvertently reinforce the societal message that survivors are safer sitting on their accounts until someone else is assaulted and comes forward.It might allow people who have survived sexual assault to get over the first-mover disadvantage but it may also codify an entrenched attitude that women need to have corroborating evidence to be believed says Mr. Hiatt of the Berkeley Law School. We have to be a little sad that we live in a world where something like this is necessary.

pri_250_db,56m payment cards compromised by malware infected .txt,"You probably heard about the Target data breach that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of the retail giant's customers into the hands of cybercriminals in late 2013. But Target's security nightmare wasn't the worst data breach in history.
Here are the 10 worst data breaches in history  so far.
Heartland Payment Systems 2008-2009: 130 million records compromised
In early 2009 this Princeton New Jersey-based payment processor announced the largest data breach ever to affect an American company. Heartland's breach exposed information from approximately 130 million credit and debit cards to cybercriminals.
Malware planted on Heartland's network recorded card data as it arrived from retailers. Because the company processed payments for more than 250000 businesses across the country the impact was huge.
In 2010 Albert Gonzalez the convicted mastermind behind the Heartland breach (as well as another huge breach) was sentenced to 20 years in prison  the longest sentence ever handed down for computer crime in a U.S. court.
Target Stores 2013: 110 million records compromised
In December 2013 retail giant Target confirmed that hackers had infected the company's payment-card readers making off with approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers that had been used at Target stores in the United States during the 2013 post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.
In January 2014 Target announced that the contact information  full names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers  of 70 million customers had also been compromised. Some of those customers probably also had credit-card data compromised in the earlier breach but it's possible that as many as 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Sony online entertainment services 2011: 102 million records compromised
In April 2011 attackers whose identities are still unknown targeted the PlayStation Network that links Sony's home gaming consoles as well as Sony Online Entertainment which hosts massively multiplayer online PC games and the Qriocity video- and music-streaming service.
Initially Sony said that only the personal information of 78 million PlayStation Network users  login credentials names addresses phone numbers and email addresses  had been exposed. But the tally of compromised accounts rose by 24.6 million when investigators discovered the attackers had also penetrated SOE and Qriocity. The credit-card data of approximately 23400 SOE users in Europe was also stolen.
Following the initial breach disclosure the PlayStation Network went dark worldwide for more than three weeks. In May 2011 Sony estimated its cleanup costs  which included fighting 65 class-action lawsuits brought against the company  at $171 million.
National Archive and Records Administration 2008: 76 million records compromised
Not all data breaches are the result of criminal activity. In late 2008 a hard drive at the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) stopped working. It held the names contact information and Social Security numbers of 76 million U.S. military veterans.
Instead of being destroyed on-site the drive was sent for repair to a government contractor which determined the drive could not be fixed  so it was sent it out to be scrapped. It is not clear whether the drive was actually destroyed.
Following complaints by an IT manager at NARA an investigation was launched and NARA changed its policies to destroy all malfunctioning storage media containing sensitive personal information.
""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII [personally identifiable information] occurred and therefore does not believe that notification [of the affected veterans] is necessary or appropriate at this time"" the agency told Wired News in 2009.
Anthem 2015: 69 million to 80 million records compromisedIn February 2015 Anthem formerly known as WellPoint and the second-largest health insurer in the U.S. revealed its customer database had been breached. Stolen data included names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers and employment histories  everything an identity thief might need. As many as 80 million current and former customers were thought to be affected.
Epsilon 2011: 60 million to 250 million records compromised
In March 2011 the Texas-based marketing firm Epsilon which handled email communications for more than 2500 clients worldwide  including seven Fortune 10 companies  announced that databases pertaining to about 50 Epsilon clients had been stolen.
Email addresses of at least 60 million customers ended up in the hands of cybercriminals and more than a dozen major retailers banks hotels and other companies were affected including Best Buy JPMorgan Chase Capital One Bank and Verizon.
Epsilon could not confirm exactly how many individuals were affected. Conservative estimates put the number of email addresses stolen at 60 million but according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a San Diego-based nonprofit advocacy group the number may have been as high as 250 million.
Home Depot 2014: 56 million payment cards compromised
In September 2014 hardware and building-supplies warehouse retailer Home Depot admitted what had been suspected for weeks. Beginning in April or May of the same year ""carders"" had infected its point-of-sale systems at stores in the U.S. and Canada with malware that pretended to be antivirus software but instead stole customer credit and debit cards.
The theft may have been the largest haul of payment cards resulting from a direct attack on a retailer if the lower estimate from the TJX breach (see below) is accepted. But unlike the Target theft less than a year earlier the Home Depot theft didn't result in customers staying away nor did it generate quite the same media outcry.
Evernote 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In March 2013 users of the note-taking and archiving service Evernote learned that their email addresses usernames and encrypted passwords had been exposed by a security breach. No financial data was stolen and the company confirmed that none of the user-generated content on its servers had been compromised.
However as had been the case for those affected by Epsilon's 2011 breach Evernote users who had their usernames and email addresses stolen were vulnerable to spam emails and phishing campaigns  some of which pretended to be password-reset emails coming from Evernote itself.
Living Social 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In April 2013 Living Social a daily-deals site partly owned by Amazon announced that the names email addresses birth dates and encrypted passwords of more than 50 million customers worldwide had been stolen by hackers. Twenty million Living Social customers whose information was stored on servers in Asia were not affected.
TJX Companies Inc. 2006-2007: At least 46 million records compromised
When it was discovered in 2007 the TJX data breach was the biggest theft of consumer data ever in the United States affecting the parent company of several major retail brands including Marshalls T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. At least 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period but some estimates put the number at closer to 90 million.
About 450000 TJX customers also had their personally identifiable information stolen including driver's license numbers. The breach ultimately cost the Framingham Massachusetts-based company $256 million.
The TJX hackers included Albert Gonzalez who was cooperating with law-enforcement investigations into earlier data thefts when he took part in both the TJX breach and the even larger Heartland Payment Systems attack two years later.
Honorable mention: Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014: Company's inner workings completely exposed
On Nov. 24 2014 staffers at Sony Pictures Entertainment the movie and television production division of Sony had their computer screens hijacked by a grinning skull. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace said it had taken over the corporate network and would release detailed company information online if unspecified demands weren't met. Within days gigabytes of internal Sony Pictures data appeared on file-sharing sites including Social Security numbers and scanned passports belonging to actors and executives internal passwords unpublished scripts marketing plans financial and legal information and even four entire unreleased Sony movies.
The company's 6800 employees plus an estimated 40000 other individuals the company had paid over previous years were placed at dire risk of identity theft and rival Hollywood studios got a detailed blueprint of Sony Pictures' accounts future plans and internal workings.Some rumors blamed North Korea others disgruntled insiders. Whatever the cause the incident threatened the very survival of Sony Pictures Entertainment as a company and may be the most damaging corporate data breach ever.

Technology|Service Members Face New Threat: Identity Theft
The government warns Americans to closely guard their Social Security numbers. But it has done a poor job of protecting those same numbers for millions of people: the nations soldiers sailors airmen and Marines.
At bases and outposts at home and around the world military personnel continue to use their Social Security numbers as personal identifiers in dozens of everyday settings from filling out health forms to checking out basketballs at the gym. Thousands of soldiers in Iraq
even stencil the last four digits onto their laundry bags.All of this is putting members of the military at heightened risk for identity theft.That is the conclusion of a scathing new report written by an Army
intelligence officer turned West Point professor Lt. Col. Gregory Conti.
The report concludes that the military needs to rid itself of a practice
that has been widespread since the 1960s.Service members and their families are burdened with a work environment that shows little regard for their personal information the report says
their units military preparedness and combat effectiveness all will pay a price for decades to come.
Lt. Col. Greg Conti who now teaches at West Point is an Army intelligence officer who helped write a critical report on how the military relies on Social Security numbers in daily interactions.
Representatives for the military say they are aware of the problem and are taking steps to fix it with the Navy and Marines making efforts in the last few months. The Defense Department said in 2008 that it was moving to limit the use of Social Security numbers and in a statement last week it said the numbers would no longer appear on new military ID cards as of May.But Colonel Conti said in an interview that the situation had not really changed: The farther you get away from the flagpole at headquarters those policies get overturned by operational realities.Social Security numbers are valuable to thieves because they often serve as a crucial identifier when dealing with banks and credit card companies. In the wrong hands they can lead to a cascade of problems like ruined credit and in turn challenges for military personnel in getting security clearances or promotions.
In 2009 Social Security numbers were used in 32 percent of identity thefts in which the victims knew how their information was compromised according to Javelin Strategy and Research which tracks identity theft.Javelin last looked at identity theft in the military in 2006 finding that 3.3 percent of active military personnel had been victims of such fraud that year slightly below the 3.7 percent in the public at large. Over all identity theft is on the rise; in 2009 the nationwide rate crept up to 4.8 percent with each person losing $373 on average Javelin estimated.Most of those incidents affect individuals or households and do not make headlines. But in June the Richmond County district attorney in Staten Island announced the indictment of a gang of identity thieves who victimized among others 20 soldiers at Ford Hood Tex.
A poster warning service members to be aware of identity theft.
According to the district attorneys office the soldiers Social Security numbers were stolen from the base by a former Army member who moved to New York and the thieves then made 2515 attempts to abuse the soldiers identities obtaining checkbooks or credit cards in their names.
Officials said some of the soldiers had been singled out because they were stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan where they would be slow to catch on to the fraud. That is
precisely the fear of military officials concerning
the vulnerability of soldiers.If youre operational and youre out there you cant do anything about the harm being done in the United States said Steve Muck the Navys chief information officer in charge of
privacy policy for Marine and naval personnel. Its a significant issue.In a major first step toward protecting Social Security numbers the
Department of the Navy expects to get the results this month from a broad review in which each department had to justify the use of the numbers on paperwork or remove them.
Mr. Muck expects that 50 percent of the uses will be found to have been unjustified.He cites practices already being dismantled that he says defy
common sense like using a Social Security number to check out a racquet or towel at the gym get a flu shot or buy a pair of pants at a ship commissary. Children of military personnel as young as 10 carry ID cards with Social Security numbers as do their parents.Six months ago the Department of the Navy introduced a campaign to alert personnel based overseas to the threat. One poster circulating in the Persian Gulf shows a Marine sitting in a Humvee clad in camouflage and manning a machine gun above
the words Whos Using My Credit Card? The poster goes on to say that an operational deployment is not the time to be worried about your identity being stolen and offers tips on detecting fraud.
In a laundry in Baghdad bags are marked with the last four digits of a soldiers Social Security number an example of the casual and insecure use of an important identifier.
Mr. Muck also has a more ambitious plan: he wants to replace the Social Security number internally with a 10-digit number that is already assigned to most service members as a computer login. He said he was waiting for approval from the Defense Department to begin carrying out this change a process that could start
early next year.Even if and when the change comes he said it would not
affect some current uses of Social Security numbers like on health care forms. And it would not affect much paperwork that is governed not by the individual branches but by the Defense Department.The new report by Colonel Conti titled The Militarys Cultural Disregard for Personal Information was published Monday on the Web site of Small Wars Journal which
tracks military affairs.Gary Tallman a spokesman for the Army said Colonel Contis report was absolutely factual
adding that the use of Social Security numbers was second nature to us.But he also said the onus falls in large part on the Defense Department to lead the changes because it uses the numbers for so many things.The Defense Department is carrying out its own review saying in its statement that it planned to tell its staff that they would need to justify every use of the numbers and eliminate unnecessary ones. But it added
that it was exceedingly difficult to determine the extent to which use of the numbers within the agency had led to identity theft.For his part Colonel Conti said he was particularly troubled by something he saw while he was deployed in Iraq.For heavens sake I stenciled portions of my Social Security number on my laundry bag in Iraq where it was memorized by foreign-national laundry workers trying to enhance their customer service he said. Id walk in and theyd say Number 1234 heres your laundry and they were very proud of that fact.

pri_250_db,united arab emirates announces it will suspend bla.txt,"U.A.E. Moves to Block BlackBerry Services - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
Global Business|Emirates to Cut Data Services of BlackBerry
About 500000 people in the United Arab Emirates use BlackBerrys many of them in Dubai a major business hub.
The United Arab Emirates citing security concerns said Sunday that it would suspend BlackBerry mobile services like e-mail and text messaging beginning in October the latest high-stakes clash between governments and communications providers over the flow of digital information.
been in a long dispute with Research In Motion the smartphones producer over the BlackBerrys highly encrypted data system which offers security to users but makes it more difficult for governments to monitor communications.The decision could have significant implications for BlackBerry use in the Persian Gulf region where Saudi Arabia has been closely studying the issue and may follow suit. Other countries including
Disputes involving privacy and censorship have flared more frequently between governments and communications providers as the Internet connects people worldwide. In July
YouTube has been periodically blocked in countries like Turkey and Pakistan and Pakistan temporarily blocked Facebook in May because of what it called offensive anti-Islamic content.Officials of Research In Motion which is based in Waterloo Ontario and the companys outside public relations firm did not respond Sunday to telephone calls and e-mail.The monitoring of information is a particularly thorny issue for autocratic regimes in the Persian Gulf
worried that the Internet might be used for antigovernment purposes  a concern heightened by the passionate online response in Iran to the 2009 presidential election that helped energize the opposition and led to weeks of unrest.The United Arab Emirates in particular were alarmed by the killing in January of a Palestinian operative in a Dubai hotel possibly by a hit team from the Mossad the Israeli intelligence agency. The episode infuriated the government which wants to encourage tourism and business and heightened its desire for increased electronic surveillance and security.
The U.A.E. has never been a place that offered much in the way of electronic privacy said Jim Krane author of City of Gold a history of Dubai. The government makes no secret that it monitors electronic communication including text messages phone calls and e-mail. The revelation that secure BlackBerry data is frustratingly out of the governments reach only confirms this.Other smartphones like the Apple iPhone are not tied to one e-mail service. In general that means e-mail to and from the devices mostly travels over the open Internet and can be relatively easily monitored.But the BlackBerry uses highly encrypted data that is received by wireless carriers towers and is immediately routed through a closed global network operated by the company. To enforce the ban the carriers will stop forwarding that data.Because of this level of security the United States government allows many military and law enforcement employees to send confidential messages by BlackBerry but it also makes surveillance correspondingly difficult.
As a result R.I.M. officials have clashed with officials elsewhere in recent years.In 2008 security agencies in India suggested that BlackBerry service might be shut down there unless R.I.M. installed servers in that country to allow them to intercept messages. The company refused but sent representatives to meet with the Indian government. Indian regulators while expressing reservations have said they have no plans to restrict the service.Analysts and telecommunications experts also believe that security concerns delayed the arrival of BlackBerry service in China. It is unclear what actions the company took if any to alleviate those worries.
There were conflicting reports Sunday about whether Saudi Arabia had also decided to ban the BlackBerry services. Some news agencies cited an interview with a Saudi Telecom official on the Al Arabiya television network that confirmed the decision but in other Al Arabiya news reports company officials denied the service would be blockedThe Saudi authorities released no official statement and an adviser to the Saudi government speaking on the condition of anonymity said no decision had been made as far as he knew.
But one prominent Saudi economist Ihsan Ali Bu-Hulaiga said it seems to me a number of other countries in the region will follow the lead of the U.A.E. for the same security-related reasons.In the emirates concerns are also fueled by the fact that native Emiratis are a minority there and the government regards electronic surveillance as an important tool against would-be terrorists swindlers and other potential troublemakers drawn to the countrys relatively unfettered environment.The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates in the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula bordering Saudi Arabia. Among the seven states are Abu Dhabi and Dubai both economic centers that encourage international trade and discourage financing of radical Islamic movements. Because of this Mr. Krane suggested the security concerns are not unfounded.
The U.A.E. is an open country a key travel and business hub with one of the worlds largest airports and airlines he said. It welcomes just about anyone to visit and even to settle and work. Nationals of many countries dont even need entry visas. In this environment the government probably feels that electronic eavesdropping and surveillance are key to maintaining internal security.In a statement Sunday a government body in the Emirates the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said officials were prepared to block BlackBerry data service beginning Oct. 11 because it was the only service in the Emirates that exported mobile data to servers outside its borders. It will not affect phone service.The agency also said that it had been trying since 2007 to strike a deal under which it would assume authority over BlackBerry services within that country.In their current form certain BlackBerry services allow users to act without any legal accountability causing judicial social and national security concerns for the U.A.E. the agency said.
While the company has disclosed little information about the centers that manage BlackBerry services it is widely believed that data from the Middle East is handled by a company operations center in Slough England.There are about 500000 BlackBerry users in the United Arab Emirates a large number of them in the business hub of Dubai.
R.I.M. has had three years to address these security concerns said a U.A.E. government official who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The dispute between the United Arab Emirates and R.I.M. took an unusual turn about a year ago when the company warned users that software described as a BlackBerry upgrade by an Emirates carrier Etisalat
was actually spyware.Independent sources have concluded that Etisalats Registration software application is not actually designed to improve performance of a BlackBerry Handheld but rather to send received messages back to a central server R.I.M. warned customers in an online posting that included directions on removing the software.

pri_250_db,google streetview cars accidentally collected wifi.txt,"HARTFORD Conn. -- Google representatives on Monday said the search engine company has not broken any laws with the collection of data for its mapping service after Connecticut's attorney general pressed the company to ""come clean with the American public.""
Authorities fear the information gathered for Google's Street View service which provides pictures of neighborhoods may violate privacy laws.
Last month Google acknowledged it had mistakenly collected data over public Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries.
Police in Germany and Australia already have launched their own investigations into the matter.
""As we have said before this was a mistake"" said a Google spokeswoman in an e-mail statement to the Associated Press. ""Google did nothing illegal and we are working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.""
The attorneys general of Connecticut and Missouri have both sent letters to Google executives asking for clarification on the information collected for Street View.
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal held a press conference Monday urging the search engine company to reveal whether it had illegally collected data from state personal and business wireless computer networks.
""People have legitimate expectations that private information will be kept private"" he said. ""These drive-by data sweeps may violate not only those expectations but also possibly the law.""
The Attorney General also said in his statement ""Drive-by data sweeps of unsecured Wi-Fi networks here would be deeply disturbing a potentially impermissible pernicious invasion of privacy"" adding ""My office can evaluate whether laws were broken.""
He said the data collection could give Google access to personal e-mails passwords and web browsing histories though he had no reports of any problems.
""Google should come clean with the American public by answering questions we have put to them about whether it intercepted information from unsecure wireless data networks while its Street View cars were taking pictures of people's homes and businesses"" said Blumenthal. ""Their credibility depends on truthful and prompt answers to these questions.""

pri_250_db,facebook begins using face recognition to automati.txt,"Automatic photo tagging: Facebook friendships get creepier  Naked Security
Automatic photo tagging: Facebook friendships getcreepier
Previous: Free farm cash from Zynga? No its another viral FacebookscamNext: Crowd sourcing the fight againstcybercrime?
The latest enhancement  or at least the latest new feature  announced by Facebook is increased automation for photo tagging.
Unlike graffiti tagging where you spray-paint your name onto someone elses property Facebook lets you paint other peoples names onto your pictures.
So even people who arent on Facebook or who choose not to identify themselves openly in uploaded photos may nevertheless end up easy-to-find online.
At the end of September Facebook made it easier to tag individuals en masse by allowing you to select and annotate a whole group of uploaded photos at once.
Now you wont need to select or group the photos yourself. Facebook will use facial recognition to match the people in your photos with other images in which they appear. Its not yet completely automatic  the tags are just suggestions  but it sounds creepy nevertheless.
You can opt out of auto-suggestion (no pun intended) but it sounds as though this feature is going to be enabled by default since Facebooks announcement advises that you will be able to disable suggested tags in your Privacy Settings. And you will be notified whenever youre tagged but only in case you want to untag yourself not in order to confirm that you want to be tagged in the first place.
A small mercy is that tagging only works between friends or what Facebook calls friends which limits the creepiness somewhat. Nevertheless it does mean that once youve been identified to Facebook by one friend you run the risk of being identified by Facebook to other friends  even those very loose friends who might not otherwise have remembered you let alone your name.
If thats not something youre comfortable with then be sure to watch out for this new feature (its coming to US users first) and turn it off.
Perhaps indeed like the vast majority of readers in our recent poll on this issue you think that Facebook features should by opt-in by default rather than opt-out. If so why not write to Facebook and tell them so?
In fact here are some words from an earlier post of mine about Facebook and privacy which you are welcome to use:
Become truly opt-in - not just on the basis that a new user opts in altogether by joining up in the first place but on the basis that everything is locked down until a new user opens up each feature.
Don't wait until the regulators in the world's developed economies start legislating to make you do so. Take the lead. People will love you all the more in the end.
More than a decade ago Scott McNealy then CEO of then-Sun famously said You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.
Dont let this throw-away remark come true. Privacy matters.
If youre on Facebook and want to stay ahead of the curve on security threats join the thriving community on the Sophos Facebook page.

I used to enjoy the legitimate security concerns raised on this blog (blogs when they were separate) about a variety of things. However you've really gone over the top with you Facebook ""series.""
It seems that you simply have something against everything Facebook does. Whenever they announce a new feature a new campaign and whatnot you immediately make up an excuse to pick on them.
Don't get me wrong. Some concerns posted here about Facebook features were very legitimate but for example when I read you post picking on the ""Facebook Hacker Cup"" I went like: ""Seriously?! WTF?""
You say things like ""their hacker contest is really just a coding competition  not hacking in the most general sense"" when in fact the term hacking in the sense you know it today (not referring to modifying hardware but to software) originated IN programming.
Programmers (coders) have every right to keep referring to themselves as hackers regardless of how security companies and the media wants to use the term. In addition ""hacking"" has been a term at the core of Facebook development since the very beginning. They constantly have internal hackatons and timed code hacking races. ""Facebook Hacker Cup"" has a lot of meaning to them and no they shouldn't have called it ""Facebook Coders' Cup"" or whatever else lame term you want just to satisfy stupidity and disinformation. The people to whom this cup is addressed know very well the meaning of hacker in that context.
But returning to this post. You say that Facebook should be opt-in which sure would be great for privacy. But you do realize that had it been opt-in Facebook would have probably been a failed experiment today right?
So you're asking Facebook to cut back on the very thing that fuels their growth and therefore their revenue  information sharing  just to become a more secure platform. Hmmm. Ok. Why doesn't Sophos release a free antivirus for small businesses then if it's all for increasing security and no money? Or at least Windows home users then (yes not Mac with its marginal market share) where it doesn't have much to loose.
I personally don't like Facebook. They screw-up things badly pretty often but man give them a break. Don't try to find flaws in simply everything they do just so you can make a new post bashing them. Everything is flawed.
Of course this is your blog and you're entitled to write whatever you please. I'm just saying that you lost one reader at least when it comes to your and your colleagues' opinions about Facebook. It has become clear to me in the past couple of days that you guys are biased.
In the ""Hacker Cup"" post and its comments  the one that really seems to have got your goat  I think I made it quite clear that I accept the use of ""hacker"" in a sense that is positive. But it _is_ a contranym  that's a word which means two opposite things like ""cleave"" which can mean to chop in half or to stick together  and thus ambiguous.
So for an organisation as popular as Facebook it would have been more responsible IMO to see them avoid that ambiguity altogether  especially when most of its 100s of 1000000s of users are probably more likely to think of ""hacker"" in the Hollywood sense than in the ""digging into the Linux kernel"" sense.
As for Facebook's ""hackathons"" and all-night coding sessionshmmm.
Been there done that. Pulling a coding all-nighter is a right of passage for a programmer. Always has been probably always will be. But you'll struggle to convince me that this is a way of producing _good_ code rather than what might be just ""a hack"".
As for ""finding flaws in simply everything they do""  that's not my goal. They produce new features way more frequently than I blog about them anyway. And if you watch some of my recent videos you'll know that I do praise them when they do something good (like putting their money where their mouth is to sue scammers) and that I exonerate them when their own users run headlong against common sense (such as Liking a site to all their friends before even looking at it).
I think you miss the point. The idea that a Photo of me or my kids was shared to Facebook and automatically tagged astounds me.
You should remind yourself that ANYTHING which is uploaded to Facebook is automatically given to them to use as they see fit. My images and those of my children are our property as long as we live not some method of driving revenue for Facebook and their connections.
Why should we have to ""opt-out"" of this why shouldn't Facebook ask us to ""opt-in""?
I value Facebook as a tool for communicating with Friends I don't value it as an untrustworthy new-media network playing on old-media rules.
Creepy indeed how far will they go. Brave New World is getting closer any minute.
I still do not understand why it is shocking that a social networking technology should be networking socially.
I am beginning to come around to the notion that new users should follow the paradigm you suggest but there are now so many layers of features and what not that sign up and adjusting your settings becomes quite an involved process.
Also there is already a privacy control for who can view tagged photos of you; depending on how you have that set this becomes something of a non-issue. In combination with the ability to create lists and alter your privacy settings in tandem with those Well personally I think all this paranoia becomes a might silly.
I think we have reached and crossed overload when it comes to trusting facebook with out data. This just shows how insecure facebook messages is. No content is safe on facebook and I have become sick of this. I have quit facebook and will be joining MyCube or Diaspora when they release as they promise to be much safer
last night FB was closed down for a while because prototypes were shown by mistake to external people.profiles were automatically changed to the new layout and some privacy settings over-rode.whatever next.opps sorry we seem to have passed all your personal info to external people get a grip facebook sort out the pedos and porn rife on site instead of messing about with layouts
This new feature has made Facebook way too dangerous for me and I have quit the site because im not sure i would like my face been recognised at all. Facebook now holds way too much information on its users and given its recent controversy about selling this information I would think its safer to quit the site and look for secure sites.
So. I wanted to send this suggested message to the folks at FACEBOOK
Errrrrr that's quite hard to find out from their site isn't it :-) According to the FB privacy policy pages you can use the form here:
But this form is expressly ""for questions or clarification about its policy"". Doesn't sound like a place for suggestions. Anyway the field for ""question or concern"" is just 40 characters wide :-)
The only other contact details I can find are that ""you may  contact us by mail at 1601 S. California Avenue Palo Alto CA 94304.""
My name was submitted by my aunt to become her friend and view her pages on FACEBOOK.
FACEBOOK sent me an invitation to view her site and sent an additional nine (9) names of people I might know.
I have never visited FACEBOOK yet they were able to make the connection between me and my friends.
I too could not find a way to contact FACEBOOK from there website (without registering myself first) seems they have secured themselves but no one else.

In a States Search for Sales Tax Amazon Raises Privacy Concerns
NORTH CAROLINA last month began an audit of online businesses assuming that millions of dollars in sales taxes owed to the state had disappeared into the Internet.
This is really an issue of fairness and equity for small businesses the brick and mortar corner store operations said Kenneth R. Lay the states secretary of revenue. These businesses are at a competitive disadvantage when they have to collect sales taxes that other businesses do not.The response of one of those online businesses Amazon.com was succinct: back off.In a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Seattle the company said that the audit violated the First Amendment and privacy rights of the customers as well as the company itself.The case offers a glimpse at the changed landscape of
privacy in the United States. Under the old model the law was meant to protect the public from a snooping government. And the government was generally the only entity with the resources to snoop on people in a systematic way.Today the online snooping (make that data collection) never stops. Can the old tools really prevent the government from closely monitoring its people when so much information is a mere Internet search away? And is the government the one we really need protection from?Amazons lawyers say the Constitution protects the company so that it may sell
a broad range of popular and unpopular expressive materials with the customers private content choices protected from unnecessary government scrutiny.The complaint gave examples of books Amazon had shipped to North Carolina: Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families by Francis Mark Mondimore and He Had It Coming: How to Outsmart Your Husband and Win Your Divorce by Stacy Schneider. The movies the complaint said included Lolita Brokeback Mountain and Fahrenheit 9/11.It is a telling list: imagine what the government could do with Converting to Islam for Dummies or Plant Your Own Marijuana Field. For this reason privacy experts say library records have been granted special protections and are generally not kept for long lest they offer a tempting target for investigators.One thing though. There happens to be an organization that does have a good idea of who is reading what
Amazon. For many isolated people Amazon is the closest thing to a library. The closest thing perhaps until Google enters the e-book business and knows what books you have bought and even what pages youve read online.In an interview Mr. Lay said North Carolina never wanted to know the titles of books or movies that were sold. It is important to know whether a book or steak was sold but we dont care about the title of the book or the type of steak he said adding that the tax rates are different in each case. We have too much data. The last thing we need is data we dont need.
The dispute over whether Amazon will have to reveal the names of its customers without the titles is still in court. To comply with their demand will reveal the personal preferences of North Carolina consumers Amazon said in a statement.The lawsuit can seem like the front line of the battle for privacy in the Internet age with Amazon on the barricades holding back an overreaching government. After all the company does not share its purchasing lists with anyone. And as Amazon argued in federal court its business would be hurt if it ever did whether in aid of tax collection or as a business proposition.Customers who fear that their purchases will not be private are less likely to purchase books movies music or other items that might be personal sensitive or controversial the company argued.What remains is a sobering combination
one hand there is the detailed information held by companies like Amazon and
Google which have a strong business incentive to fight off the government. Yet even as they go to court to protect the information they have collected that information still represents a honey pot for the government Cindy Cohn legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation says.In cases where the government gains a courts approval it would have access to a trove of material that 10 years ago would be unthinkable in its detail.Thats why we are trying to convince all people who store data not to do it she said. We need to strengthen the law that when we collect information for one purpose it isnt used for another.In addition there is all the material that roams freely available on the Internet particularly on social networks like Facebook which are convinced that more sharing is what their users want.This information can find its way to the government without need of a warrant Joel R. Reidenberg a professor of law at Fordham University says. And while each piece of data can seem innocuous when collected and weaved into a personal profile it can be quite revealing.If a private company has information they can sell it including to the government he said. You need a warrant when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy he added but if a private company has the information on what basis would someone expect it to be private from the government?The bleed from privately held data to state surveillance can happen very quickly he said.

pri_250_db,instances of home surveillance footage showing mis.txt,"Using Video Surveillance to Catch the Neighbors - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
STEVE MILLER is justifiably proud of the manicured grounds around his stately stucco home in Palm Beach Gardens Fla. So he was nonplussed last year when he discovered that someone had been tossing plastic bags of dog excrement into the sculptured shrubs around a palm tree in his front yard.
It was a pile of at least 10 bags said Mr. Miller 55 who owned a dance costume business in Bristol Pa.
before retiring to Florida in 2005. I had my suspicions but wanted to find out for sure which one of my neighbors was doing it.So Mr. Miller
went to a local electronics store and bought a $400 do-it-yourself video surveillance kit.
In so doing he joined the ranks of outraged homeowners who are recording their neighbors misdeeds. Attracted by the declining prices and technological advances of such devices these homeowners are posting the videos online to shame their neighbors or using them as evidence to press charges.
With their cameras hidden in bushes or dangling from windows these homeowners are outing not just littering dog owners but also
bottle snatchers and car scratchers. Although Mr. Millers surveillance system came with two motion-activated cameras he used only one of them anchoring it with a zip tie to a concrete balustrade outside an upstairs window and running the wire inside where he plugged it into a DVR.
A months worth of video footage clearly showed one of his neighbors slinging bags of dog feces into his yard.
Youd see him come from all directions and even turn around afterwards  like I was his dumping destination and not just a convenient stop on his way said Mr. Miller who showed the video evidence to his communitys security patrol. They were stunned and wrote the guy a citation for improper waste disposal littering and leash law violations.Moreover the neighbor had to pick up all that he had tossed. Mr. Miller also had some fun at the neighbors expense
narration. The video has had more than 4000 views.
He never apologized so thats why I posted it Mr. Miller said. But I did wait until after he moved.There are countless videos online that are intended to settle scores between neighbors. Whereas such disputes were once
the individuals involved now they can have a much wider audience whose members often take sides and post
comments.Take Adam Kliebert 41 a real estate developer in Houston who last year trained a video camera on his driveway in an attempt to catch his neighbor Woody Densen a former state district judge
scratching the back of his car. The video which was posted online and delivered to the police shows Mr. Densen walking behind the vehicle. Although the front of the car obscures the former judges actions he pleaded guilty last April to criminal mischief a misdemeanor and paid for $3000 worth of damages to Mr. Klieberts Range Rover.
Robert Pelton the lawyer for Mr. Densen said he did not damage the car and pleaded guilty only in order to avoid trial.
out the $2000 he paid for the surveillance equipment.
But he said: I dont care. I wanted to catch him and he knows its there so he wont try anything.
Despite a history of animosity that predates the car incident the two men remain neighbors.Prices for surveillance equipment have been falling for the past five years; systems that
once cost thousands of dollars now cost hundreds. Popular do-it-yourself kits by manufacturers like Logitech Swann Defender and Lorex currently cost between $150 and $2500 depending on the number of cameras digital storage capacity wireless capability and whether a monitor is included.Moreover many of these systems can now transmit to smartphones so that people can watch activity on their property remotely. There are also apps that alert homeowners when video equipment detects motion in a particular area such as
Executives at Swann Lorex and other makers of do-it-yourself surveillance systems report that
sales are now evenly split between businesses and residences. Five years ago
do-it-yourself surveillance is free software like SupervisionCam
which will turn any computers Webcam into a motion-activated video camera. It works by detecting the changes in pixelation that occur when something moves and alters the scene. Kenneth Gore 43 an unemployed welder who lives in Pinellas Park Fla. used the software to document a neighbors cats prowling and fouling the yard around his mobile home.Mr. Gore
looking in his windows while he was away. After he showed the video to the manager of the mobile home park Mr. Gore said The trespassing stopped because they know theyre being filmed. (Trespassers will also get soaked by a motion-activated sprinkler Mr. Gore bought to drive away the cats.)Mr. Gore posted videos of his nosy neighbors
and of the sprinkler squirting the cats on YouTube. One video has
and music from the vintage British television comedy The Benny Hill Show.
The other is narrated by the cartoon character Tweety Bird: I tawt I taw a puddy tat! The two have had more than 43000 views.
A lot of people get mean posting videos like that said Mr. Gore. I thought it was better to be humorous.Do his videos anger his neighbors?
There aint much they can do about it he said.Indeed the law seems to be on Mr. Gores side because he recorded only what was happening in his yard. It matters how youre doing it and why but generally its true that you can film your own property as well as anything that is in public view said David Ardia director of the Citizen Media Law Project at Harvards Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
Its when you extend your senses into unexpected places like using a telephoto to film whats going on in your neighbors bedroom that you could run into trouble.
Representatives of neighborhood security patrols police departments and animal protection agencies said that video has helped them deal with situations that in the past would have been one neighbors word against anothers. Its hard to argue with video evidence said Officer Bruce Borihanh
a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. And its a powerful deterrent if people consider their actions could end up on YouTube.Video evidence led to the arrest of Jay Risners neighbor in St. Clair Shores Mich.
Mr. Risner 29 an engineer for a phone company noticed laundry detergent and redeemable
bottles disappearing from his basement shortly after a new neighbor moved into his condominium complex in 2008. I thought it was him but you need proof before the cops can do anything Mr. Risner said.Using a $400 wireless surveillance system Mr. Risner set up a camera in the basement and got his proof.
Within two days he had video of his neighbor entering his basement and rooting around which he posted online earlier this year after both he and his neighbor had moved.
The video doesnt show him actually taking anything Mr. Risner said but it was enough for the police to arrest him for home invasion and take him to jail.The neighbor was ordered to pay restitution for what he had stolen as well as for a new door lock for Mr. Risners basement 
surveillance cameras that are trained on both the front and back doors.Im not sure now he said whether to worry more about my neighbors or strangers.

The Next Data Privacy Battle May Be Waged Inside Your Car
Garmin sells a windshield-mounted camera and data recorder.
Cars are becoming smarter than ever with global positioning systems Internet connections data recorders and high-definition cameras. Drivers can barely make a left turn put on their seatbelts or push 80 miles an hour without their actions somehow somewhere being tracked or recorded.
Automakers say they are only responding to consumer demand and besides they and regulators say the new technologies help them better understand consumers and make the cars safer. But privacy advocates increasingly see something more unsettling for drivers: that someone is always watching.Now two senators are trying to give car owners more say over some of that data. Early next week Senator John Hoeven Republican of North Dakota and Senator Amy Klobuchar Democrat of Minnesota will introduce a bill stipulating that car owners control the data collected on the device called the event data recorder. The recorder commonly known as a black box collects information like direction speed and seatbelt use in a continuous loop. It is in nearly every car today and in September it is set to become mandatory.Weve got real privacy concerns on the part of the public Senator Hoeven said in a telephone interview. People are very concerned about their personal privacy especially as technology continues to advance he said referring to revelations of spying by the National Security Agency. Fourteen states have already passed similar laws.The data collected by the black box has already been the center of litigation by law enforcement agencies and insurance companies seeking to use the information against car owners. The bill would limit what the data could be used for and would require a warrant to release the data without the owners consent.But even this legislation covers only part of what is a rapidly evolving technological landscape.At the International CES in Las Vegas this week automakers and technology companies announced a stream of new products and services aimed at making cars more connected.
Google announced it had a partnership with G.M. Audi Honda and Hyundai to bring its Android platform to vehicle infotainment systems by the end of this year. At the same time G.M. said it would start an app shop where drivers can use apps like Priceline.com to book a hotel room and CitySeeker which provides information about attractions and restaurants near the vehicle.The days of a driver being alerted to a deal at a retailer as he drives nearby are rapidly approaching.Many consumers though are unaware of just how much personal information is collected and used privacy advocates say.Manufacturers do a poor job of informing consumers and explaining the privacy implications of new technology said Khaliah Barnes of the Electronic Privacy Information Center a consumer group based in Washington. Often that information is in the owners manual and whens the last time you thumbed through your owners manual?It didnt help the automakers reassurances about their handling of data when Jim Farley Ford Motor Companys top sales executive who is known for making off-the-cuff comments told a panel at the CES: We know everyone who breaks the law. We know when youre doing it. We have GPS in your car so we know what youre doing. Although he quickly added By the way we dont supply that data to anyone and later issued a full retraction the comments even if overblown and meant to be provocative fueled the concerns.
Vehicle owners Ms. Barnes said should be able to request the information manufacturers record and delete information at their discretion.Consumers should decide what level of surveillance they want to be under Ms. Barnes said. None of that should be on default. You should have to opt in.Automakers say that consumers are eager for the new products. At the CES G.M. introduced a new camera in the 2015 Corvette Stingray designed to give track enthusiasts real-time feedback on their driving. The performance data recorder as it is called uses a camera mounted on the windshield and a global positioning receiver to record speed gear selection and brake force.The Corvettes system goes further than traditional black boxes.A camera mounted on the windshield records the drivers point of view and a microphone in the cabin records any noises made in the car.Chevrolet said that the consumer owned the data which is collected in a digital card housed in the glove compartment.But privacy lawyers say that the information can still be used against a driver as well as G.M. and its suppliers in litigation or by an insurance company investigating a drivers habits.The privacy and liability issues associated with the P.D.R. are as real as with any archived data that can be used by or against individuals said William Kohler a lawyer at Clark Hill in Detroit.The new brainpower in cars puts the industry in new territory with security and data privacy said Thomas Kowalick an expert in event data recorders and a former co-chairman of the federal committee that set the standard for black boxes.The major concern is not what an E.D.R. gathers now but that future in-vehicle technologies will make it possible to virtually record and track a vehicles movement from point A to point B Mr. Kowalick said.Garmin introduced a new windshield-suctioned camera that turns on automatically when the car starts. It records wide-angle footage as well as speed location and time in the event of a collision and also has a microphone that can record sound from within the car.We hope it takes some of the he said she said out of an incident in your car said Ted Gartner a spokesman.He said the devices owner also owned the data and that Garmin could not access it.Theres no way that we have access to that data because theres no way to transfer the data out of the car wirelessly Mr. Gartner said.Despite these and other assurances the new products are attracting scrutiny in Washington.On Monday the Government Accountability Office released a report stating that some automakers were keeping private data collected from onboard navigation systems and mapping apps for varying lengths of time and that car owners could not request that it be erased.The report which was requested by Senator Al Franken Democrat of Minnesota found that the 10 automakers navigation device manufacturers and application developers surveyed did not make owners aware of all the risks of the data collection like allowing third parties to track their location or gather sensitive information such as their religious and political activities and preferences.Information about your location is extremely sensitive said Senator Franken who is chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and said he planned to introduce a bill that would legislate guidelines on when a vehicle owners location could be shared. If someone has a record of your location they can figure out where you live where you work the doctors you visit and where your kids go to school.

New Russian Internet Data Law Raises Questions About Privacy And Compliance
The Kremlin's attitude toward the Internet has cooled since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in 2012. (file photo)
Dirty Jokes: Internet Awash With Memes Mocking Russia's Detergent Ban
Russian Prosecutor-General Orders Closure of Pro-IS Accounts On VKontakte
A controversial new Russian law on the retention of personal computer data has gone into force raising questions about the possible impact on the world's largest Internet companies and the privacy of the customers they serve -- and whether the law can even be effectively enforced.
The law which took effect on September 1 requires Russian and foreign companies to store data for customers who are Russian citizens on servers housed on Russian territory.
That has sparked concerns among privacy advocates who fear the law will further restrict speech in Russia where the Internet has served as a freewheeling and largely unhindered forum for public debate particularly compared with traditional media outlets.
Michael Sulmeyer director of The Cyber Project at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center said Russia isn't the first country to explore asserting more control over computer users' personal data.
But he said ""the big test for the principle is certainly Russia and it's not too terribly surprising given what's been happening in Russia recently.""
Despite earlier efforts by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev now the prime minister to instill a Silicon Valley-style ethos in Russia the Kremlin's attitude toward the Internet has cooled since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in 2012. Last year Putin publicly called the Internet a ""CIA project.""
Regulators have also adopted increasingly strict regulations on bloggers requiring them to register if they reach a certain threshold of readerships or followers.
Earlier this year Russia's media oversight agency Roskomnadzor threatened to shut down Wikipedia's Russian site because it contained material about marijuana.
Companies that don't comply with the new law will be included in a blacklist under court order by Roskomnadzor and subject to a fine of up to 300000 rubles or around $5000. Roskomnadzor can also order Internet providers to block access to violators.
It was unclear exactly what impact the law would have on major international Internet companies and which ones would comply the law.
According to Roskomnadzor eBay and PayPal are among the most notable companies agreeing to house data on Russian-based servers along with hardware makers Lenovo and Samsung and the web-based taxi service Uber.
""The challenge that Russia finds itself in is how you enforce your law on companies and services that aren't based in Russia?"" said Danny O'Brien international director for the nonprofit advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation.
""If Russia is requiring Facebook and Google house servers in their territory what's to stop any other country from requiring the same thing?"" he added. ""It's a race to the bottom.""
Among those whose compliance was in doubt however was Facebook. The Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported on August 26 that the U.S.-based social media giant did not intend to comply with the law.
Roskomnadzor confirmed in a statement that its chief had met with a Facebook representative but declined to characterize the discussions.
Facebook which is headquartered in California refused repeated requests to comment. A spokesman told RFE/RL in an email: ""We regularly meet with government officials and have nothing more to share at this time.""
Microsoft said only that some of its services were subject to the new law and that the company would comply with those services.
""We don't believe we customize or market our consumer services to Russian citizens in a way that makes them subject to the new law"" a company spokesman said in a statement.
Google refused to comment on the law as did other major companies such as IBM.
Samantha Lein a spokewoman for the Wikimedia Foundation said the site had built-in privacy protections that help protect users anonymity: both their names and their Internet Protocol addresses which can be used to locate specific computers.
""We have been following the development of [the new law] but don't believe it affects Wikipedia given that we intentionally keep as little information as possible about our users"" she said in an email. ""However we do think that overly strict territorial requirements are problematic for the future of the Internet.""
Online auctioneereBay declined to make a representative available for questions but said the company ""makes every effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations around the world in order to best serve our customers. eBay is committed to the Russian market and looks forward to continuing to connect customers there.""
Anton Nossik a widely read blogger whom many consider the godfather of the Russian blogosphere said that the law's many faults included the lack of a sensible way to distinguish between the citizenship of users.
In a September 1 blog post Nossik said that Wayback Machine -- a San Francisco-based online archive for other websites -- had been blocked briefly by at least one Russian Internet service provider. It was unclear if the reported blockage was specifically related to the new law.
The website reportedly holds about 150 billion iterations of different sites worldwide going back to 1996.
Nossik called the new law a ""crooked and moronic normative act"" that from a legal standpoint is about as useful as toilet paper.

Court to Rule on Right to Privacy for Referendum Petition Signers
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether the First Amendment requires that the names of people who sign ballot-initiative petitions be kept secret.As in the courts decision on Wednesday to block the broadcasting of the trial of a
challenge to a ban on same-sex marriage in California the appeal was brought by opponents of such unions who said they feared harassment should their views be made widely known.The new case arose from an effort to overturn a Washington State domestic partnership law known as the everything but marriage act. Opponents of the law gathered more than 130000 signatures enough to place a referendum on the November ballot.Several groups asked the state to turn over the names under its public records law and two groups said they intended to post the names on the Internet. Their goal according to a news release was to encourage conversations among friends relatives and neighbors that can be uncomfortable for both parties.Protect Marriage Washington a group that supports traditional marriage sued to block release of the names saying disclosure would probably result in threats harassment and reprisal.A federal judge granted the request but the judges order was overturned by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.The Ninth Circuit panel said it was unclear whether petition signatures were speech protected by the First Amendment. In any event it
said the signatures were gathered in public with no promise of confidentiality and collected on sheets with space for 20 signatures each.Even if the names had warranted some First Amendment protection the panel said that protection was overridden by two justifications: protecting the integrity of elections through transparency and providing voters with information about who supported placing the referendum on the ballot.As in the same-sex marriage case the Supreme Court intervened at an unusually early stage in the Washington case staying the Ninth Circuits ruling in October. That had the effect of blocking disclosure of the names through the election in November. The effort to overturn the everything-but-marriage act failed.Washington Families Standing Together a group supporting equal rights for same-sex couples joined the State of Washington last month in urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case. The group said the evidence of potential harassment was limited to a small handful of cursory declarations many of which concern incidents occurring in California or elsewhere.James Bopp Jr. a lawyer for Protect Marriage Washington said in a statement that the Ninth Circuits decision infringed the rights of citizens who support a traditional definition of marriage to speak freely and without fear.No citizen Mr. Bopp
added should ever worry that they will be threatened or injured because they have exercised their right to engage in the political process.The Supreme Courts decision in the case Doe v. Reed No. 09-559

Eli Lilly Settles FTC Charges Concerning Security Breach
Company Disclosed E-mail Addresses of 669 Subscribers to its Prozac Reminder Service
Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges regarding the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information collected from consumers through its Prozac.com Web site. As part of the settlement Lilly will take appropriate security measures to protect consumers' privacy.""Even the unintentional release of sensitive medical information is a serious breach of consumers' trust"" said J. Howard Beales III Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""Companies that obtain sensitive information in exchange for a promise to keep it confidential must take appropriate steps to ensure the security of that information.""Lilly a pharmaceutical company based in Indiana manufactures markets and sells several drugs including the anti-depressant medication Prozac. Lilly operates the Prozac.com Web site which the company promotes as ""Your Guide to Evaluating and Recovering from Depression."" Several of Lilly's Web sites including www.prozac.com and www.lilly.com collect personal information from visitors. From March 15 2000 until June 22 2001 Lilly offered to consumers the ""Medi-messenger"" e-mail reminder service. Consumers who used Medi-messenger could design and receive personal e-mail messages to remind them to take or refill their medication. Once a consumer registered for Medi-messenger the reminder messages were automatically e-mailed from Lilly to the subscriber at the e-mail address she or he had provided and according to the subscriber's requested schedule. These reminders were individualized e-mails and did not identify any other subscribers to the service.On June 27 2001 a Lilly employee created a new computer program to access Medi-messenger subscribers' e-mail addresses and sent them an e-mail message announcing the termination of the Medi-messenger service. The June 27th e-mail message included all of the recipients' e-mail addresses within the ""To:"" line of the message thereby unintentionally disclosing to each individual subscriber the e-mail addresses of all 669 Medi-messenger subscribers.According to the FTC's complaint Lilly claimed that it employs measures and takes steps appropriate under the circumstances to maintain and protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information obtained from or about consumers through its Prozac.com and Lilly.com Web sites. For example Lilly's privacy policies included statements such as ""Eli Lilly and Company respects the privacy of visitors to its Web sites and we feel it is important to maintain our guests' privacy as they take advantage of this resource.""The FTC complaint alleges that Lilly's claim of privacy and confidentiality was deceptive because Lilly failed to maintain or implement internal measures appropriate under the circumstances to protect sensitive consumer information which led to the company's unintentional June 27th disclosure of Medi-messenger subscribers' personal information (i.e. e-mail addresses). In fact according to the complaint Lilly failed to: provide appropriate training for its employees regarding consumer privacy and information security; provide appropriate oversight and assistance for the employee who sent out the e-mail who had no prior experience in creating testing or implementing the computer program used; and implement appropriate checks and controls on the process such as reviewing the computer program with experienced personnel and pretesting the program internally before sending out the e-mail. Lilly's failure to implement appropriate measures also violated a number of its own written security procedures.The proposed settlement would bar misrepresentations about the extent to which Lilly maintains and protects the privacy or confidentiality of any personal information collected from or about consumers. Additionally Lilly would be required to establish and maintain a four-stage information security program designed to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect consumers' personal information against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to its security confidentiality or integrity and to protect such information against unauthorized access use or disclosure. Specifically Lilly would be required to:Designate appropriate personnel to coordinate and oversee the program;Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security confidentiality and integrity of personal information including any such risks posed by lack of training and to address these risks in each relevant area of its operations whether performed by employees or agents including: (i) management and training of personnel; (ii) information systems for the processing storage transmission or disposal of personal information; and (iii) prevention and response to attacks intrusions unauthorized access or other information systems failures;Conduct an annual written review by qualified persons within ninety (90) days after the date of service of the order and yearly thereafter which shall monitor and document compliance with the program evaluate the program's effectiveness and recommend changes to it; andAdjust the program in light of any findings and recommendations resulting from reviews or ongoing monitoring and in light of any material changes to Lilly's operations that affect the program.Lilly's security breach was the subject of a July 2001 petition from the American Civil Liberties Union requesting that the FTC investigate and take appropriate action to remedy the breach.The Commission vote to accept the proposed settlement was 5-0. An announcement regarding the proposed consent agreement will be published in the Federal Register shortly. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days after which the Commission will decide whether to make it final. Comments should be addressed to the FTC Office of the Secretary 600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. Washington D.C. 20580.In a concurring statement Commissioner Orson Swindle stated that he was pleased with the consent agreement that the Commission has reached with Eli Lilly and Company. He said that ""Lilly's unfortunate and unintended disclosure of prescription drug users' personal information has given us all the opportunity to evaluate how to improve upon security practices for confidential information. Lilly should be respected for its long-standing efforts in development of its privacy practices its acceptance of responsibility for the internal failures that resulted in the alleged violation of its privacy policy and its willingness to take appropriate steps to correct those mistakes."" Commissioner Swindle stated that he appreciates the company's leadership in cooperating with the FTC to improve its security measures and he believes the firm will carry out fully its commitments under the proposed order. ""Lilly's responsiveness"" he stated ""and its efforts to improve corporate privacy practices can be a model for others to follow.""NOTE: Consent agreements are for settlement purposes only and do not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent order on a final basis it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of $11000.Copies of the complaint and order are available from the FTC's Web site at http://www.ftc.gov and also from the FTC's Consumer Response Center Room 130 600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. Washington D.C. 20580. The FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent deceptive and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot stop and avoid them.

Why Some Privacy Apps Get Blocked From the Android Play Store
android play store privacyAndroid Privacydisconnect.me blocked from android play storeGoogle blocks privacy app
Some developers of privacy apps believe Google is blocking their apps from the Android Play Store to protect its business model.
Google Tuesday removed a smartphone app called Disconnect Mobile from its Android Play store because it violated a policy prohibiting software that interferes with other apps.
Interference was precisely the point of Disconnect Mobile a privacy tool aimed at stopping other apps from collecting data on users. In the six days it was available in Googles store it was downloaded more than 5000 times.
Disconnect a San Francisco startup that spent a year and $300000 to develop the app says it was careful to build its product according to Googles rules but that the policies are so vague that Google could in essence ban any app in its store.
Its like a Kafka novel  youre getting kicked out or arrested for reasons you dont even know says Casey Oppenheim Disconnects co-founder.
Google has banned similar ad-blocking apps before because they too could interfere with other apps. When we were kicked out virtually every other ad blocker was kicked out as well said Ben Williams a spokesman for Eyeo maker of Adblock Plus which was removed from the Play store in March 2013.
Google declined to comment on the removal of Disconnect and other privacy apps. Our policies are designed to provide a great experience for users and developers. Thats why we remove apps from Google Play that violate those policies a Google spokeswoman said.
The controversy reflects the control that Google and rival Apple
exert through their app stores. Even at the height of its powers by contrast Microsoft
did not control the distribution of apps for its Windows operating system for personal computers.
There is no reason why you shouldnt have the same degree of control over the computer you have in your pocket as you do over your computer on your desktop Oppenheim says.
He and others suggest Google doesnt like ad-blocking apps because they interfere with its primary business of selling ads.
The culture in the mobile space appears to be that theres a data free for all says Peter Eckersley technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Dozens of apps aimed at protecting users privacy are available in the Play store promising to help users opt out of being tracked for ad targeting or spot which companies are tracking them.
For instance Ghosterys Ad Control app asks companies to opt users out of targeted advertising on mobile devices. However users still see ads and the app doesnt block tracking without first asking advertisers. AppBrain Ad Detector displays the advertising services embedded in apps that users have downloaded onto their mobile devices. However AppBrain stresses that it does not block ads. The DuckDuckGo and Ixquick browsers block cookie tracking and block Google from collecting data on a users browsing behavior.
The ability to collect data from users is one perk of developing apps for the Android ecosystem developers say. Googles rules force users to agree to a blanket request for data before they use an app. On Apples iPhone users can opt out of specific requests as they go.
The Android permission requests can prompt their own concerns. Some Facebook
users were alarmed earlier this month when they saw the disclosure for Facebooks Messenger app which included permission to read users contacts and text messages download files without notification. Facebook said it wouldnt take advantage of the permissions and said it had no control over the wording of the permissions which were written by Google.

@Erik I disagree with your post and i'm pretty sure it gave me cancer.
Typed that too fast apparently sorry about the misspellings.
Funny thing is that not even ads do what some of these apps do adblocker just pointed me to this article when I tried to reach another website is that their business to modify my pages ?? Never seen gogole dot hat or any of the ads they are saying they block but thge blocker did it. Just like that other time it decided to replace all images with cats. Maybe the problem are these apps and their self righteous developers that apaprently think my browser is theirs jsu tbecause I installed their plugin.
Disconnect has been around for some time as a browser plugin. Its called disconnect because it disconnects you from third party tracking companies who are storing information about everything you read/watch/listen to etc. without your knowledge or consent.
Google is an evil corporation. It uses the open source community to create their products for free then perverts the ethics/values used when creating those products by including proprietary spyware (Google services all Google apps). They did it with Android and they did it with Chrome.
Where can you get Disconnect Mobile for Android? Their website currently only has the iOS version. Nothing on thepiratebay kickass and other torrent sites at the moment.

pri_250_db,"hulu sharing video watching histories, along with .txt","The HULU Plus app is played on a Samsung Galaxy phone in this photo-illustration in New York December 23 2013.
Hulu has failed to persuade a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the video streaming service of illegally sharing users' viewing history with Facebook Inc and business metrics company comScore Inc.In San Francisco on Friday U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler rejected Hulu's argument that viewers needed to show actual injury to recover damages even if they qualified as ""aggrieved"" persons under a 1988 federal law protecting the privacy of video renters.That law the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) was adopted after a newspaper published an article in 1987 about movies that Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork had rented.Hulu had argued that the law ""was not adopted to impose multi-billion dollar liability on the transmission of anonymous data where no one suffers any actual injury.""Beeler however concluded that ""the statute requires only injury in the form of a wrongful disclosure"" before damages might be available. She did not rule on the merits of the case.
Hulu is a joint venture owned by Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal 21st Century Fox Inc's Fox Broadcasting and Walt Disney Co's ABC. Chief Executive Mike Hopkins said on December 18 Hulu will post $1 billion of revenue in 2013 up from $695 million in 2012.Hulu spokeswoman Meredith Kendall declined to comment on the decision saying Hulu does not comment publicly on ongoing legal matters.The lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of Hulu users nationwide. It was brought by several people in California Illinois and New York seeking damages of at least $2500 per violation plus punitive damages and other sums.
These plaintiffs claimed that Hulu let third parties engaged in marketing advertising and social networking track their video choices without permission.They claimed that Hulu sent such information to Scorecard Research a comScore market research unit and sent ""Facebook IDs that linked their video choices to personally identifiable Facebook registration information.""
David Parisi a lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.Hulu has separately argued it would be too hard to certify a class of plaintiffs. It noted that many users employ fake names including 644 named ""Homer Simpson"" 450 named ""Mickey Mouse"" 131 named ""Santa Claus"" and 18581 named ""John Doe.""A February 6 2014 hearing has also been scheduled on Hulu's second motion to dismiss the case. There Hulu claimed it did not knowingly transmit protected information to Facebook and comScore in a manner that violated the VPPA.The case is In re: Hulu Privacy Litigation U.S. District Court Northern District of California No. 11-03764.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Krista Hughes)

Google Buzz Privacy Issues Have Real Life Implications
Merging something designed for public broadcasting (Buzz) with something inherently private (Gmail) was just looking for trouble.
Google is -deservedly  getting a lot of heat for the fact that its latest social product has a number of privacy flaws baked into it by design.
Theyve since made some improvements to the product but thats not where the story ends.
Some people think the complaints are unwarranted and the issues not all that bad while some think its mostly annoying and others dont even know there are issues yet (or that Google launched something new at all). And then there those whose lives are already being impacted by the privacy loopholes in Google Buzz  and not all in a good way.
See for example this story of an anonymous woman who writes a (self-proclaimed) feminist blog which she started after leaving an abusive marriage. (found on Hacker News)
I use my private Gmail account to email my boyfriend and my mother.
Theres a BIG drop-off between them and my other most frequent contacts.
Which is why its SO EXCITING Google that you AUTOMATICALLY allowed all my most frequent contacts access to my Reader including all the comments Ive made on Reader items usually shared with my boyfriend who I had NO REASON to hide my current location or workplace from and never did.
You can read the rest of the story in the blog post but needless to say this woman is justifiably very angry with the Mountain View company.
Now Im sure some of our readers will have an answer ready. That she should have changed this setting or not have touched that one but that would be beside the point. Which is that even with the improvements that were made to the Buzz product Google is confusing the hell out of people here  and make some lives hell for them to boot.

Twitter Reverts Changes To Blocking Functionality After Strong Negative User Feedback

Update: Twitter has reverted the changes to blocking functionality that it made earlier today. After the changes an outpouring of negative user feedback appeared on Twitter blogs and other services. We hear Twitter executives began hashing this one out in internal discussions almost immediately after negative sentiment started to rise and Reuters reported that an emergency meeting was held to discuss the changes.
Twitter obviously made these changes for a reason and both statements given to us by Twitter and things that weve heard indicate that there were many requests made to eliminate the blocked notice. Specific accounts of reprisals in response to a blocked person being notified of being blocked spurred this change.
But at this point it appears that at least some re-thinking of the feature is in order and Twitter appears to be choosing to roll these changes back for now until it can come up with a system that works for the majority of users.
Either way Twitter deserves some credit for responding quickly and decisively to revert what was obviously a very unpopular change.
Here is Twittersstatement courtesy of VP of Product Michael Sippey:
Earlier today we made a change to the way the block function of Twitter works. We have decided to revert the change after receiving feedback from many users  we never want to introduce features at the cost of users feeling less safe. Any blocks you had previously instituted are still in effect.
In reverting this change to the block function users will once again be able to tell that theyve been blocked. We believe this is not ideal largely due to the retaliation against blocking users by blocked users (and sometimes their friends) that often occurs. Some users worry just as much about post-blocking retaliation as they do about pre-blocking abuse. Moving forward we will continue to explore features designed to protect users from abuse and prevent retaliation.
Weve built Twitter to help you create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. That vision must coexist with keeping users safe on the platform. Weve been working diligently to strike this balance since Twitters inception and we thank you for all of your support and feedback to date. Thank you in advance for your patience as we continue to build the best  and safest  Twitter we possibly can.
Twitter has introduced a new blocking policy that is materially different from the one that theyve had in the past. Blocked users can now see your tweets while logged in and continue to follow you on the service allowing potential harassers or abusers to continue to track your updates on the network even though youve explicitly blocked them.
This greatly reduces the effectiveness of some aspects ofthe block functionality on Twitter and opens the door for those who have been harassed or stalked on social networks to have their updates monitored more easily. Blocked users can now retweet your tweets fave them and RT them while logged into their account.
TechCrunch spoke to Twitter about the changes and the company says that the change which does not notify or alert the person youve blocked in any way was done to prevent a scenario of retaliation. The company said that they had seen situations where users once they discovered that they had been blocked  because they could no longer view tweets or interact with tweets  would find other ways to attack or harass the blocker or even be spurred to greater abuse.
Twitter says that another reason for the change is to better communicate to users that blocked does not mean invisible and that your information is still public.
This new method means that the only way to prevent someone from following you or interacting with your tweets is to make your account completely private. This will prevent anyone you block from seeing your tweets.
While we doubt Twitter had anything but good intentions here changing blocking because a blocker might be antagonizing or inciting someone theyve blocked just by blocking them will likely not sit well with victims of harassment.
Its worth noting that you could previously view the public tweets of users that had blocked you while logged out of the service  and by visiting a profile page. But now they can do it while logged in and interact with them. If youve blocked them you will notsee these interactions but others will and those you have blocked will still be able to fave tweets for instance and see those in a list of tweets that theyve faved.
This new blocking method is more of a mute filter that prevents you from seeing any tweets or interactions from a blocked follower. But those interactions still happen. In some ways this new method is actually a more accurate picture of what happens with a Twitter account when you block someone. They could always see your tweets and manually RT them to their followers by copying and pasting text. Now however they can do so within the constructs of Twitter  you just cannot see them. Though their followers and anyone searching for your name can.
Twitter notes that those tweets may also show up in your searches.
Any updates from that user in your Home timeline including any of their Tweets that were retweeted by accounts you follow
Any interactions with that users Tweets or account (i.e. favorites follows or Retweets) in your Interactions or Activity tabs
If your account is public blocking a user does not prevent that user from following you interacting with your Tweets or receiving your updates in their timeline. If yourTweets are protected blocking the user will cause them to unfollow you.
Have their @replies or mentions show in your mentions tab (although these Tweets may still appear in search).
See your profile picture on their profile page or in their timeline.
Privacy note:If your Tweets are public (i.e. notprotected) they will still be visible on your public profile page to anyone regardless of whether they have a Twitter account or not.
Wedo notsend notification to a user when you block them but because they will no longer be able to follow you they may notice that theyve been blocked.
The changes to Twitters policy may indeed prevent some immediate knowledge that a user has been blocked though they didnt get a notification before and still wont get one now. It could cause a lag between the time that they get blocked and when they realize it  but the scenario by which this couldprevent retaliation once discovered gets blurrier.
Many Twitter users who have been abused and who undergo continuous harassment on Twitter  especially women  will likely not be pleased that their tweets can now be easily favorited and re-tweeted within the confines of Twitters platform. Yes their tweets were never truly private because Twitter is a public service  but a policy that makes it easier to interact with tweets and add commentary to them (even if its not visible to you personally) seems like its missing the point.
Twitter is a global social networking platform that allows its users to send and read 140-character messages known as tweets. It enables registered users to read and post their tweets through the web short message service (SMS) and mobile applications.
As a global real-time communications platform Twitter has more than 400 million monthly visitors and 255 million monthly active users around

COMMENTEMAILMOREWe all know better than to read YouTube comments the ignorant barely literate epithets that malign gender race and sexual preference -- when they're not spamming for profitable work-at-home jobs -- posted below a video of cat inside a cardboard box. Arguably the site is better known for the hate-spewing mouth-breathers who lurk in the comment sections than the videos themselves.Uploaders and commenters with both brains and consciences have been clamoring for a fix for years. So Google valiantly stepped in and implemented a measure which it announced would put a cap atop YouTube's troll volcano.But it's only made things worse.YouTube has integrated Google+ into its commenting system so that a user must sign in with their Google account in order to comment on a video. The move was put into place to weed out the anonymous venom that billows from beneath the main attraction but many users see it as both a further deterioration of privacy and a blatant attempt to force everyone onto Google's social network.It also doesn't help that it's one of the most poorly implemented features the company has made in recent memory.The backlash began soon after the new comment section's debut. Folks decried the inability to weigh in on videos anonymously or even have a separate (and completely innocuous) online persona than their actual name and identity. Many users relied on anonymous screen names not for the purpose of posting untraceable angry diatribes but to have some semblance of privacy from Google's marketing and data collection.Sure there is a sizable YouTube audience who wouldn't mind the elimination of anonymity -- a powerful tool for comment trolls -- in order to deter boorish posts. But as anyone who's read a comment section that allows for Facebook logins knows actual names really don't do much to curb cruel and moronically insipid conversations.Speaking of social networks...After two years Google+ continues to be the metric system of social networks: A simpler more optimal system with greater compatibility that nevertheless remains irrelevant until everyone else switches over. While it boasts a user base of over 540 million you're still much more likely to find your friends' activity on Facebook or Twitter. So it's no surprise that many users were outraged and perplexed as to why they had to use their dormant accounts as a means to ""improve"" a broken system.In fact that outrage was voiced by none other than one of YouTube's co-founders Jawed Karim who posted the very first YouTube video and went on to sell the site to Google for $1.65 billion. Despite the massive paycheck he didn't have any kind words for the Search Giant in a recent post on his YouTube account. Simply put it reads ""why the [expletive] do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?""There are enough reasons to find the new comment section to be a clunky solution to a serious problem. And yet Google managed to screw it up even more.Prior to the switch comments would reach a more prominent position based on user upvotes or if the uploader replied to them. But now when organized by ""Top Comments"" posts can hit the top of the section simply by having the greatest number of replies. So those same sexist bigoted remarks that were flagged and hidden can now achieve maximum readability just by having the most counterpoint replies. This has also been proven to be a boon to spammers with a wealth of fake Google+ accounts replying to the original spam post enough times to reach the top.Yes fake Google+ accounts are still easy to create and act as the very same anonymous screen names that Google was trying to quash. Ban one user and he or she can simply sprout two more like a Hydra of hate.But defying all logic the new YouTube comments allow hyperlinks and an unlimited character limit. If you thought a Rick Astley video was the very worst thing you could blindly click on then you haven't accidentally clicked on a virus or seen the graphically large ASCII art of genitalia -- both of which now propagate the YouTube comment section.The Google+ integration has baffled and enraged the very people who made YouTube a success: the content producers. One notable uploader nicknamed boogie2988 posted an impassioned plea to Google to fix all the aforementioned problems with YouTube.Only two days old the video hit the front page of Reddit and has amassed over 822000 views at the time of this writing. Hopefully its popularity will force Google to notice the mess it's made.If not just read the video's comment section and realize that nothing absolutely nothing has changed for the better with Google+ integration.This story originally appeared on Minyanville.FACEBOOK: Watch Out Facebook!

pri_250_db,"healthfirst, is notifying approximately 5300 affec.txt","Notice of Data Privacy Incident -- NEW YORK July 24 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
NEW YORK July 24 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Healthfirst 100 Church Street New York New York 10007 is notifying approximately 5300 affected members and past members that their personal information may have been compromised in the course of a criminal fraud scheme perpetrated against Healthfirst. Social Security numbers and credit card information were not affected.
On May 27 2015 Healthfirst was informed by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") that an individual who perpetrated a fraud against Healthfirst may have stolen information about Healthfirst's patients from Healthfirst's online portal. Healthfirst had discovered that it was the victim of fraud in 2013 notified the DOJ and cooperated with the DOJ's investigation which resulted in the perpetrator being charged with fraud. During its investigation the DOJ discovered that the perpetrator had gained access to some member information and recently notified Healthfirst of that fact. Healthfirst immediately launched an investigation of its own and hired forensic experts to determine what patient data was accessed. On July 10 2015 we determined that the perpetrator gained access to certain Healthfirst members' personal information between April 11 2012 and March 26 2014.
Healthfirst determined that the following types of information relating to Healthfirst members appears to have been accessed by the provider: name address date of birth health insurance plan information description of missing services physician number Healthfirst member ID number patient ID number claim number diagnosis code Medicare and Medicaid ID number.
Beginning July 25 2015 Healthfirst will mail letters to each of the affected members. Notice is being provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulators as required and will be posted on Healthfirst's website.
Healthfirst sincerely regrets that this incident occurred. Healthfirst takes the privacy and security of its members' health information very seriously. Healthfirst values the trust its members have placed in it as their health plan and it is Healthfirst's priority to reassure its members that it is taking steps to ensure its members' information is protected.
Healthfirst is providing affected individuals with access to one year of free identity and credit monitoring and restoration services along with access to a confidential assistance line and an identity theft protection specialist. Healthfirst is taking steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future including reviewing and updating its policies procedures and online portal security. Healthfirst has informed affected individuals that they may contact the confidential assistance line if they have any questions or if they would like more information. The confidential inquiry line can be reached between 9am and 9pm ET Monday through Saturday at 877-220-1388. Individuals should use reference number 9344071715.
To further protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss individuals are encouraged to remain vigilant to review account statements and to monitor credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law individuals are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order a free credit report an individual can visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free 1-877-322-8228. Individuals may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of the relevant credit report.
Individuals are encouraged to regularly review any Explanation of Benefits statement received from insurers for suspicious activity. If an individual does not receive regular Explanation of Benefits statements he or she can contact his or her insurer and request copies. Individuals may want to order copies of credit reports and check for any unrecognized medical bills. If an individual finds anything suspicious he or she can call the credit reporting agency at the phone number on the report. Individuals should keep a copy of notices in case future problems arise. Individuals may also want to request a copy of medical records from providers to serve as a baseline.
At no charge an individual can also have these credit bureaus place a ""fraud alert"" on his or her file that alerts creditors to take additional steps to verify his or her identity prior to granting credit in his or her name. Note however that because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures it may also delay an individual's ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies his or her identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms an individual's fraud alert the others are notified to place fraud alerts on the individual's file. Should an individual wish to place a fraud alert or have any questions regarding a credit report he or she should contact any one of the agencies listed below. Information regarding security freezes is also available from these agencies.
Individuals can further educate themselves regarding identity theft security freezes and the steps to take to protect themselves by contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC 20580; www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/; 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338); and TTY: 866-653-4261. The FTC encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. Information on how to file such a complaint can be found at the FTC website listed above.

Privacy Concerns Raised Over Kids Apps And Websites
Zivame Lands $40M To Change How Women In India Buy TheirLingerie
Given the sophisticatedtracking technologies embedded intoso many digital products and services as a matter of course it shouldcome as no surprise that a global privacy audit of childrens websites and apps has highlighted big concerns aboutthe collection and use of kids data. That doesnt make it acceptable however.
The Global Privacy Enforcement Network a network of global privacy regulators conducted a jointresearch project last May involving 29 data protection regulators looking at just under 1500 websites and apps targeted at or popular with children. Reporting their findings now theyve raisedconcernsaboutclose to a majority (41 per cent) of the services especiallyaround how much personal information is beingcollected from minors and how that dataisthen shared with third parties.
Among the overall findings reported by the U.K.s ICO are that:
67% of sites/apps examined collected childrens personal information
Only 31% of sites/apps had effective controls in place to limit the collection of personal information from children. Particularly concerning was that many organisations whose sites/apps were clearly popular with children simply claimed in their privacy notices that they were not intended for children and then implemented no further controls to protect against the collection of personal data from the children who would inevitably access the app or site
Half of sites/apps shared personal information with third parties
22% of sites/apps provided an opportunity for children to give their phone number and 23% of sites/apps allowed them to provide photos or video. The potential sensitivity of this data is clearly a concern
58% of sites/apps offered children the opportunity to be redirected to a different website
Only 24% of sites/apps encouraged parental involvement
71% of sites/apps did not offer an accessible means for deleting account information
Per country results vary with Frances CNIL data protection agency saying it found 87 per cent of the 54 websites it looked at were collecting personal data such as name email IP address identifying the mobile terminal and the users location. And for more than 63 per cent of sites children could be redirected to another website (including a commercial website)with a single click. While just 18 per cent of the subset of sites it looked at prompt users to ask for parental consent to access the content.
None of this is surprising given the rampant tracking technologies developed to monetize free services via ad targeting. But as more regulatory attention is paid to the user data heist thats going on in the background of the digital economy thenmorepressure will build to enforce stronger consumer protections anda stricter data protection regime.
In the U.S. for instance there is a fresh attempt to pass a Do Not Track Kids Act this year. While big tech providers such as Google and Apple have been responding to criticism about how kids and apps collide bycreating dedicatedkids zones within their contentmarketplaces or offering programs where developers can opt in to an additional review layer such as Google Plays Designed for Families program to gain a kid-friendly certification.
Such moves are of course welcome but only cover digital products that are availablewithin certain subsections of the Web. If kids are accessing websites and apps that arent explicitly designed for them  such as Tumblr or Twitter or Facebook for instance  then theres no such safeguards in place. The onus remains on parents to be aware which apps and websites their kids are accessing.
Ultimately the core issue here isthedigital economysreliance on ad-powered business models which apparently encourage theobfuscation of userdata collection;disingenuous approaches to gaining user consent for data collection and processing; and a rank lack of transparency about what happens to and with userspersonal data generally.
Yet as barely a week goes by without another huge data leakdigital consumers are bound to start askingmore questions about how and for what purposes their personaldata is being appropriated. And those tech companies thatpublicly stand up for privacy will stand out as trustworthy while those that keep quiet will seemas if they have something unsavoryto hide.
Commenting on the kids-focused research in a statement the ICOsAdam Stevens said:
These are concerning results. The attitude shown by a number of these websites and apps suggested little regard for how anyones personal information should be handled let alone that of children.Internationally we saw some websites and apps gathering more information than we felt they needed and sharing that data with third parties.
The most common concern domestically was a lack of information being provided about how their information would be used. We saw generic privacy policies that simply werent specific enough and some without any information at all which isnt good enough.
Well now be writing out to the sites and apps that caused us concern making clear the changes we expect them to make. We wouldnt rule out enforcement action in this area if required.
The Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN) was created to strengthen personal privacy protections in this global context by assisting public authorities with responsibilities for enforcing domestic privacy laws strengthen their capacities for cross-border cooperation.

Brian Kabateck poses with JustMugshots.com Anne Cusack / Los Angeles Times Brian Kabateck a Los Angeles attorney filed a lawsuit alleging that JustMugshots.com misappropriates peoples likenesses for commercial gain a violation of Californias civil code. Brian Kabateck a Los Angeles attorney filed a lawsuit alleging that JustMugshots.com misappropriates peoples likenesses for commercial gain a violation of Californias civil code. (Anne Cusack / Los Angeles Times)
In 2010 Zim Rogers was waiting to hear from his bosses about whether he would be promoted.Rogers who works in global securities said that instead of getting a better job he was fired after a cursory Google search turned up an 11-year-old mug shot and records in Florida of an arrest on suspicion of drunk driving and driving without a license  charges that were later reduced to misdemeanors and dismissed his attorney said.
The Los Angeles resident thought his record was firmly behind him. Little did he know then that there's a cottage industry of websites that make money reminding people of their run-ins with the law.JustMugshots.com where Rogers' arrest record had been posted is among several that operate legally in the United States turning a profit using public records. The sites cull photos and arrest records from law enforcement agencies across the country and post them online.
""You would think 'Geez I can go about my life'"" Rogers said. In the next few years however he shelled out an estimated $2000 to remove the photo from several websites including $299 paid to JustMugshots.com. He said the online record made it difficult to find a job.In theory getting a photo taken down is easy  if you're willing to cough up as much as several hundred dollars.Rogers is the plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking class-action status that was filed in December in California against JustMugshots. Rogers is seeking general damages as well as an injunction against the website to keep it from operating. Lawsuits have also been filed in at least two other states  Florida and Ohio  against similar website operators.Those who have had the misfortune of landing in a website's gallery say that having an arrest record so easily found harms employment prospects and causes humiliation. Even those who were never charged or had cases dismissed have had trouble getting photos taken down.""It struck me as so outrageous at first blush"" said Brian Kabateck a Los Angeles attorney who filed the California suit. ""It's some version of extortion.""The lawsuit alleges that the website's practices misappropriate people's likenesses for commercial gain a violation of California's civil code.""In an age when a primary source of information is the Internet [JustMugshots.com's] conduct is akin to taking out a billboard on a busy highway"" the lawsuit said. The suit ""seeks to stop defendant from profiteering from the public humiliation of arrested individuals.""In an email in response to an inquiry from The Times a JustMugshots.com representative said he didn't have ""any comment on this lawsuit right now as we haven't had a chance to really take a close look at it yet.""On its website the company makes its stance clear: ""We believe that you have a right to be informed"" the tagline reads. ""The right to high-quality accessible information about the arrests in your area; to know if your neighbors or even your son's little league coach has been arrested.""The proliferation of these types of websites in recent years has prompted legislation in some states to curb the industry.Utah for instance enacted legislation in May that prohibits people from using jail booking photos unless the person requesting the records signs a statement swearing the photos won't be posted online and a fee charged to take them down. Legislation is advancing in New Jersey that would prohibit the publishing of booking photos if the person arrested has not been convicted.Such legislation however has the potential to limit public access to important records said Emily Grannis Jack Nelson legal fellow at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.""We understand the way these companies go about using these records is causing people real damage"" she said. ""But the solution to that is not to punish all members of the public by depriving them of access to what we think are critical records. The solution is to punish these people who are using these photos to embarrass and almost blackmail people.""Legal experts however say that charging a fee to remove arrest records is not extortion because website operators do not demand payment before publishing the records which are public in most states.Kabateck's lawsuit alleges that JustMugshots.com is profiting off the likenesses of people whose photos they post. The complaint said the website is violating a provision of the civil code that ""protects an individual from the appropriation of name and likeness that brings injuries to feelings [and] disturbs peace of mind.""The company's practice ""violates public policy because it is immoral unethical oppressive unscrupulous and substantially injurious to consumers"" according to the suit.Part of the reason the site has so much reach the lawsuit said is because JustMugshots.com uses search optimization techniques to ensure that when a person's name is searched online any arrest record ranks high in the results.Google Inc. said it has tweaked its search engine to lower the ranking of these types of search results. Some payment processors such as Discover MasterCard and PayPal said they no longer allow payments to be processed for these sites.But as long as the websites can operate legally it appears such efforts mean the website operators will find a workaround.""It's like Whac-a-Mole"" Rogers said. ""The only purpose of this lawsuit is that this whole thing wasn't going away.""ricardo.lopez@latimes.comTwitter: @rljourno

Opt-Out Cookie Error Earns Chitika A Whopping 55 Cents And An FTC Inquiry
Footbo Raises $2.5 Million Swings For The Fences With New Fantasy BaseballGame
Search-targeted advertising network Chitika reached a settlement this week with the Federal Trade Commission over illegally tracking consumers behavior online. According to the FTC Chitika allowed users to opt out of having cookies placed on their browsers and receiving targeted ads but unfortunately Chitikas opt-out only lasted 10 days. After this period Chitika continued to track these consumers behavior on the web even though they opted out. This took place from at least May 2008 through February 2010 says the FTC. Chitika says this was an unintentional error in their tracking systems.
How much was it worth to Chikita to flaunt the privacy rules? Not much. Chitika tells us that it earned an estimated $0.55 from the users who requested to opt out but were tracked starting ten days after their request instead of ten years. Basically their claim is that this was totally accidental and not a way to create more revenue (illegally) for the network. Chitikas cookies track search history and sites visited but the network says no personally identifiable information is collected  the cookies contain no information on a users name age gender etc.
The FTC settlement not only bars Chitika from obviously doing this again but also requires that every targeted ad include a hyperlink that takes consumers to a clear opt-out mechanism that allows a consumer to opt out for at least five years.
The FTC also mandated that Chitika destroy all identifiable user information collected when the defective opt out was in place. In addition the settlement requires that Chitika alert consumers who previously tried to opt out that their attempt was not effective and they should opt out again to avoid targeted ads.
Chitika says that since March 1st 2010 Chitikas opt-out cookies have been set to last for ten years which is twice the length required by FTC regulations. While the ad network didnt profit from the error the fact is that they broke a law by illegally tracking consumer behavior without their consent. And Chitika seems remorseful enough: Obviously it would be incredibly stupid of us to intentionally break the rules of online privacy over a million dollars much less fifty-five cents says Chitika CEO Venkat Kolluri.
But the FTC has been broadly cracking down on ad networks and web sites that track consumer behavior without consent most recently calling for a Do Not Track system for websites. Perhaps Chitika only deserved a slap on the wrist instead of a public flogging.
Chitika is an online ad network that caters over four billion strategically targeted ads each month to a network of over 250000+ sites making it the second largest network of its kind. Chitika ads are known across the industry for their ability to perform unlike any other leveraging its proprietary targeting and optimization technology - a delicate blend of Art + Science- to ensure delivery

pri_250_db,growth of apps that use face recognition to determ.txt,"Face Recognition Moves From Sci-Fi to Social Media - The New York Times

Business Day|Face Recognition Makes the Leap From Sci-Fi
Immersive Labs in Manhattan has developed software for digital billboards that gauges the characteristics of passers-by in order to display ads likely to attract them.
FACIAL recognition technology is a staple of sci-fi thrillers like Minority Report.
But of bars in Chicago?SceneTap a new app for smart phones uses cameras with facial detection software to scout bar scenes. Without identifying specific bar patrons it posts information like the average age of a crowd and the ratio of men to women helping bar-hoppers decide where to go. More than 50 bars in Chicago participate.As SceneTap suggests techniques like facial detection which perceives human faces but does not identify specific individuals and facial recognition which does identify individuals are poised to become the next big thing for personalized marketing and smart phones. That is great news for companies that want to tailor services to customers and not so great news for people who cherish their privacy. The spread of such technology  essentially the democratization of surveillance  may herald the end of anonymity.And this technology is spreading. Immersive Labs a company in Manhattan has developed software for digital billboards using cameras to gauge the age range sex and attention level of a passer-by. The smart signs scheduled to roll out this month in Los Angeles San Francisco and New York deliver ads based on consumers demographics. In other words the system is smart enough to display say a Gillette ad to a male passer-by rather than an ad for Tampax.
Smart signs using facial recognition software are scheduled for introduction in three cities this month.
Those endeavors pale next to the photo-tagging suggestion tool introduced by Facebook this year. When a person uploads photos to the site the Tag Suggestions feature uses facial recognition to identify that users friends in those photos and automatically suggests name tags for them. Its a neat trick that frees people from the cumbersome task of repeatedly typing the same friends names into their photo albums.Millions of people are using it to add hundreds of millions of tags says Simon Axten a Facebook spokesman. Other well-known programs like Picasa the photo editing software from Google and third-party apps like PhotoTagger from face.com work similarly.But facial recognition is proliferating so quickly that some regulators in the United States and Europe are playing catch-up. On the one hand they say the technology has great business potential. On the other because facial recognition works by analyzing and storing peoples unique facial measurements it also entails serious privacy risks.Using off-the-shelf facial recognition software researchers at Carnegie Mellon University were recently able to identify about a third of college students who had volunteered to be photographed for a study  just by comparing photos of those anonymous students to images publicly available on Facebook. By using other public information the researchers also identified the interests and predicted partial Social Security numbers of some students.Its a future where anonymity can no longer be taken for granted  even when we are in a public space surrounded by strangers says Alessandro Acquisti an associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon who directed the studies. If his team could so easily infer sensitive personal information he says marketers could someday use more invasive techniques to identify random people on the street along with say their credit scores.
Today facial detection software which can perceive human faces but not identify specific people seems benign.Some video chat sites are using software from face.com an Israeli company to make sure that participants are displaying their faces not other body parts says Gil Hirsch the chief executive of face.com. The software also has retail uses like virtually trying out eyeglasses at eyebuydirect.com and entertainment applications like moustachify.me a site that adds a handle bar mustache to a face in a photo.But privacy advocates worry about more intrusive situations.Now for example advertising billboards that use facial detection might detect a young adult male and show him an ad for say Axe deodorant. Companies that make such software like Immersive Labs say their systems store no images or data about passers-by nor do they analyze their emotions.But what if the next generation of mall billboards could analyze skin quality and then publicly display an ad for acne cream or detect sadness and serve up an ad for antidepressants?You might think its cool or you might think its creepy depending on the context says Maneesha Mithal the associate director of the division of privacy and identity protection for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. Whatever consumers think she says they should be able to choose whether to be subject to such marketing practices. (The F.T.C. is planning a workshop next month on facial recognition.)ON Facebook people who find the photo-tagging suggestion program creepy may turn off the system that proposes their names to friends who are uploading photos. If people opt out Facebook deletes their facial comparison data according to the site. Users may also preapprove or reject being listed by name in a friends photo before it is posted on their profiles.Those options may suffice for many.But in Germany where German and European privacy regulations require private companies to obtain explicit permission from a person before they store information about that individual merely being able to opt out does not go far enough says Johannes Caspar the commissioner of the Hamburg Data Protection Authority. (Although the United States has federal data protection laws pertaining to specific industries like credit and video rental no general law requires that all companies obtain explicit consent before storing personal data about an individual.)Mr. Caspar says many users do not understand that Facebooks tag suggestion feature involves storing peoples biometric data to re-identify them in later photos. Last summer he asked Facebook to give current users in Germany the power to delete their biometric data and to give new users in Germany the power to refuse to have their biometric data collected in the first place. In the long term he says such popular uses of facial recognition could moot peoples right to remain anonymous.Mr. Caspar said last week that he was disappointed with the negotiations with Facebook and that
his office was now preparing to take legal action over the companys biometric database.Facebook told a German broadcaster that its tag suggestion feature complied with European data protection laws.There are many risks Mr. Caspar says. People should be able to choose if they want to accept these risks or not accept them. He offered a suggestion for Americans Users in the United States have good reason to raise their voices to get the same right.

pri_250_db,aol instant messenger found to log chats perhaps i.txt,"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has raised concerns about the latest version of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) an application used for sending and receiving instant messages on Macs PCs and portable devices including iOS devices. According to the EFF:
The new preview version of AOL Instant Messenger raised privacy concerns for us when it was first introduced first because it started storing more logs of communications and second because it apparently scanned all private IMs for URLs and pre-fetched any URLs found in them.
The EFF met with AOL to discuss these issues but in a recent blog post they said:
...we still recommend that AIM users do not switch to the new version as it introduces important privacy-unfriendly features.
Mac users may not be aware but when they use iChat they are using AOL Instant Messenger. Apple's iChat uses AOL's servers to connect Mac users. Here's a screen shot of the Server Settings tab in iChat's Accounts preferences; you can see that the server used is an aol.com server:
The biggest privacy issue with the latest version of AIM is that it logs your chats for up to two months or potentially indefinitely. While this may not be a serious issue for most users data breaches could allow malicious users to obtain such logs which might contain personal information phone numbers passwords and more. In addition ""your private conversations are now available to for instance law enforcement agents with a warrant or a national security letter (In other words be careful what you send by iChat.)
In addition to this those people you chat with who are not using AIM may not be aware that their chats are being logged. While the new AIM will warn users the first time you initiate a chat if you are using the new version of AIM and there is option for the person using the new AIM to turn off logging this is unclear and inconsistent. Macworld's Dan Miller wrote about this recently pointing out that after he deleted the new version of AIM these messages persisted and it wasn't at all clear whether chats were indeed being logged or not. It seems that once you log into your iChat account with the new AIM this logging is turned on and you simply cannot turn it off.
You cannot go ""off the record"" if you are using an alternative client like iChat or Pidgin or if you switch back to an earlier version of AIM. And if the other participant in the chat is not using the new AIM that person cannot toggle the conversation off the record such that it is not stored by AOL. Finally there is no off the record mode for the new group chat feature at all. All group chats on AIM will be logged.
Another element of the new AIM is that the program scans all URLs in chats in order to attempt to embed photos or videos in chat windows. Even if these links don't lead to photos or videos they are scanned and stored in logs. Yet this too cannot be turned off. The EFF says that ""it does not look like there will be a way to permanently opt out of the link downloading behavior."" It addition ""Since conversations can only be marked ""off the record"" from inside the new AIM users of older versions or alternate clients will always be prone to having some of the links they send scraped even though they wont see them rendered.""
Finally the EFF points out that users were not warned about this URL fetching service and are not given an option to turn it off. As with many such privacy changes it is best to inform users of what is changing and offer them a chance to opt in to the new features. AOL has not done so and most users are not aware of what is happening. Users should carefully consider whether they want to install the new AIM. iChat users won't see any changes on their end but their contacts who do have the new AIM installed will cause chats with them to be logged.
The EFF's final verdict is clear: ""Because signing onto the new version of AIM permanently changes your account settings to log all conversations to AOLs servers by default we recommend that existing AIM users do not upgrade.""

pri_250_db,high school student victim of sexual abuse outs pe.txt,"Savannah Dietrich outs her rapists on Twitter and Facebook
Can Twitter and Facebook Help Rape Victims Find Justice?
SlateThe XX FactorWhat Women Really ThinkJuly 23 2012 9:32 AM
A teenage sexual assault victim took to Twitter to out her assailants and now faces jail time.
Last summer 16-year-old Savannah Dietrich went to a party had some drinks and passed out. Then two acquaintances sexually assaulted her took pictures and forwarded them to their friends. News of the public assault tore through Dietrichs Louisville high school. Dietrich was forced to just sit there and wonder who saw who knows? The public humiliation culminated this June when her assailants struck a plea deal on charges of felony sexual abuse and misdemeanor voyeurism that Dietrich felt amounted to a slap on the wrist. And the court had an order for Dietrich too: Dont talk about it or risk 180 days in prison and a $500 fine.
First Dietrich cried. Then she logged online. ""There you go lock me up"" she tweeted to a couple hundred Twitter followers outing her assailants by name. ""I'm not protecting anyone that made my life a living Hell. These men had made their assault on her public. Now they had convinced a court to keep it all under wraps. If reporting a rape only got me to the point that I'm not allowed to talk about it then I regret it she wrote in a note on her Facebook wall. I regret reporting it.
Public officials and victims advocates have long grappled with the question of why more than one-half of rape victimsdo not report the crime to police. Rape trials can be long grueling humiliating stigmatizing alienating and ultimately difficult to prove. But as Dietrich's case shows the criminal justice process can also rob the victim of control over her own narrative. Reporting to official channels often means keeping quiet in social ones. Even when the story hits the pressas is the case of the local Louisville report on Dietrich now 17the accused rapists names often remain unpublished.
Now young victims like Dietrich are ""reporting"" the assault directly to the people who need the information mostother women living in these rapists' communities. And theyre risking their own names and reputations in order to bring their assailants out into the open. In 2010 19-year-old American University student Chloe Rubenstein took to Facebook and Twitter to out two men on campus she said had victimized several of her friends (ATTENTION WOMEN she wrote. They are predators and will show no remorse for anyone.) In 2007 a group of women at Portlands Lewis & Clark College led by sophomore Helen Hunter created a Facebook group calling one of their classmates a Piece of S--- Rapist. When the administration caught wind it suspended the man for just a semester. But five years later? Google his name and the online rape allegations still register as the fourth hit.
The tactic has its risks. Women who report rapes through unofficial channels can be shamed for making public claims that have not been proven in a court of lawor else for ruining the reputations of boys who have made ""mistakes."" Dietrich faces jail time. Rubenstein fielded late-night threatening phone calls from her rapists friends. Victims with even less social cloutDietrich is white and middle-class and is speaking out with the help of her family and legal counselcan expect even less support. But the costs of staying silent are high. In her Facebook note Dietrich said that her attackers gave people the impression that its okay to do that to me  making me look like a whore and increasing my chances of getting raped again. We know thatthe majority of acquaintance rapistsarerepeat offenders. When campus and criminal processes fail to catch these predators social media can provide a powerful patch.
Last night Dietrich unlocked her Facebook page to the hundreds of strangersmyself includedwho have requested to make her a friend. They have flooded her wall with offers of financial support and links to Change.org petitions calling for justice in her case. Of course Dietrich is also fielding spammy notes from strangers with dogs for avatars (since they took pictures isnt this child pornography?) and all-caps rants about the sex offender registry.
But here Dietrich is the editor of her own story. She has the power to delete the comments she doesnt like and promote the ones she does. Thanks to a few brave tweets a 17-year-old rape victim is now curating an international conversation about sexual assault in America. Shes created a public Twitter account to represent her new online role. And shes speaking out not only about the details of her own assault but the ways that the justice system is failing others like her. All I am hoping for out of this is to get not only justice for myself but to future victims she wrote in response to one commenter offering of financial support. The laws that protect criminals shouldnt cross over and take away victims rights. Victims rights should come first. And thank you.

WisBar NewsSeptember142015Sender Had No Expectation of Privacy in Text Messages on Recipients PhoneDeborah G. SpanicEmailPrintSaveComments (0)FacebookTweetlinkedInGoogle+
Sept. 14 2015  A state appeals court has ruled that a homicide defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in text messages that he sent to the victims phone which allowed police to obtain a warrant for more text messages sent between the parties.
In 2012 Delafield police officer Landon Nyren responded to a call about a death and found the body of Wayne Wilson. Wilson had a fentanyl patch in his mouth and the medical examiner listed acute fentanyl intoxication as the cause of death.
While at the Wilson residence Nyren found Wilsons phone and retrieved text messages from it including messages between Wilson and Ryan Tentoni which appeared to be a discussion about Tentoni obtaining fentanyl patches for Wilson.
Fentanyl patches contain narcotic pain medication. After Wilson sent a text saying the patches did not affect him Tentoni suggested that Wilson suck on a patch evidence that Tentoni may have contributed to Wilsons death by chemical intoxication.
Deborah Spanic Marquette 2004 is a guest writer for the State Bar of Wisconsin. She can be reached by email.
Relying on the information contained in the text messages on Wilsons phone Nyren obtained a warrant for Tentonis phone records including 350 text messages between Tentoni and Wilson in the month of November and into the first week of December.
Tentoni moved to suppress the text messages found on Wilsons phone and those obtained with the warrant. The circuit court denied the motion finding Tentoni had not made a showing of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information he sent Wilson. Tentoni ultimately pleaded guilty to an amended charge of second-degree reckless homicide and was convicted. He then appealed to the court of appeals.
But in State v. Tentoni 2014AP2387-CR (Sept. 9 2015) a three-judge panel for the District II Appeals Court affirmed concluding that Tentoni did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages he sent to Wilson.
In drafting the courts opinion Chief Appeals Court Judge Lisa Neubauer first discussed the reasonable expectation of privacy as afforded by the Fourth Amendment.
In order to have standing to challenge a search on Fourth Amendment grounds a defendant must have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area or items subjected to a search. In addition the defendant bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
In reviewing the factors applicable to this case the panel concluded that Tentoni did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages contained in Wilsons phone.
Tentoni had no property interest in Wilsons phone and Tentoni had no control over Wilsons phone or any right to exclude others from text messages he sent to Wilson. The panel noted that Tentoni did not claim that he took steps to enhance the privacy of his text messages or that he ever told Wilson to keep those messages private.
The panel noted that other jurisdictions have ruled that the sender of a letter has no privacy interest in the contents of that letter once it reaches the recipient and the same analysis has been applied to emails and texts.
In a similar case from Rhode Island for instance the court noted that phone ownership is the most important factor in determining whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages that are sent to that phone finding that the sender relinquishes control over messages received on the recipients phone.
In closing the court noted that once Tentoni sent the messages to Wilson and Wilson received them Tentoni had no control over whether Wilson saved them deleted them forwarded them to others or shared their content in any way. As a result the panel held that Tentoni had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages.EmailPrintSaveComments (0)FacebookTweetlinkedInGoogle+

After Privacy Uproar Quora Feeds Will No Longer Show Data On What Other Users Have Viewed
Posted Aug 14 2012 by Colleen Taylor (@loyalelectron) Contributor
MetaLab Relaunches A Sexy New Ballpark Officially Becomes A Design CapitalInvestor
Updated. Earlier this month Q&A site Quora unveiled a new feature Views. One of the most noticeable aspects of Views was that it displayed information about the exact posts that other users of the site had looked at in its user feeds. At the time we noted that it could certainly rub some folks the wrong way  Quora is a site that definitely plays into natural human curiosity but what you view on the web is a pretty personal thing.
After a significant uproar from users (documented quite well on Hacker News) Quora has opted to shut off the feature in Views that shows data about what others are viewing in the main Quora feed. Other parts of Views such as viewership data inside posts themselves and analytics reported to post authors will remain active.
In some ways this could be seen as a failure of communication more than anything. Many people who objected to the feature did not seem to be aware that from the get-go topics such as adult content were omitted from Quoras Views feature and Views were only tabulated on topics that people were following  posts that users came across via search for example were never public. But Views in feeds omitted the via details that let others know why that view was being shown to others  so the folks at Quora are taking it out altogether.
A big part of Views was having that via reason that says Mark viewed this thing because hes following Movies or Personal Finance. If you see anything [as a View on Quora] the via should show you that its a result of that Quora product manager Sandra Liu Huang told me in a phone call today. Our feed stories didnt show that via reason and that confused people.
This is breaking news and well update this post with more information as it is available. For now here is the official blog post from Quora:
We launched Views a couple weeks ago to offer a new way of discovering content on Quora and to let writers get a sense of who they can reach through Quora. While many were really interested in these new stories we also got a lot of feedback that people werent comfortable having what they viewed shared broadly with people following them. So were going to stop showing stories in feed about what people are viewing.
The rest of the Views product remains the same  when Quora shows you content in feed (based on the topics and people you publicly follow) we record those views and display them on the question answer or post page.
The topics and people you follow are displayed as the Via reason next to each of your views. E.g. if I follow Job Interviews and see What are the best questions to ask a potential employer in a job interview? in my feed then my name will be listed as seeing this question Via Job Interviews.
The only views we ever record are: views from feed topic pages you follow and clicks on digest emails.
Not included: anything you get to from searches; looking at other users profiles; and any adult content. Read more.
You can still delete any individual view or turn off views from your Settings (www.quora.com/settings) page.
Weve appreciated your feedback and interest in Views as well as your encouragement to the writers who create great content on Quora.
Quora is a question-and-answer website created edited and organized by its owners. It was founded in 2009 and is based in Palo Alto California.

Revenge porn: First woman sentenced for offence is spared jail
Paige Mitchell 24 is handed a six-week suspended jail term for posting
Paige Mitchell 24 arriving at Stevenage Magistrates' Court charged with posting revenge porn pictures of her girlfriend on FacebookPhoto: National News and Pictures
A vindictive woman who posted sexually explicit pictures of her girlfriend on Facebook to hurt and humiliate her has become the first female to be sentenced under new revenge porn laws.
Paige Mitchell slapped her girlfriend and uploaded four explicit pictures complete with insulting captions after a row where she accused her partner of looking at other women.
Her revenge left her girlfriend embarrassed to walk down the street for fear people had seen the intimate photographs a court heard.
Mitchell aged 24 and from Stevenage was handed a six-week suspended jail term after pleading guilty to assault and the new offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress.
Sentencing her at Stevenage Magistrates Court chairman of the bench Bette Hindmarsh said: ""Posting the photos on the internet was a highly vindictive invasion of privacy.
""It was done with the intention of humiliating and hurting your victim.""
Stevenage Magistrates' Court Photo: National News and Pictures The court heard the lesbian couple had been in a tempestuous relationship for more than a year before the fight.
Tariq Iqba defending said: ""Arguments were fairly common during the relationship.
""This time an argument started because the victim was accusing her of having an affair with someone else.""
Mitchell admitted slapping her victim and going over the top"" during the argument which got so heated that neighbours knocked on the door asking them to keep the noise down.
Mitchell packed her bags and stormed off and days later the victim received a phone call from her brothers girlfriend saying the photos had been posted on Mitchells Facebook profile.
""People who I didn't want to see my body have seen me (naked). I don't want to feel like that.""
Mitchell said the images were sent by her partner during their relationship. She posted four of them but removed them when her mother told her it was against the law the court heard. The images had been online for half an hour.
In a witness statement the victim - whose one-year-old child was sleeping during the argument at Mitchell's home on May 12 -said the incident ""made me feel embarrassed embarrassed to walk down the street"".
She said: ""People who I didn't want to see my body have seen me (naked). I don't want to feel like that.""
Paige Mitchell 24 arriving at Stevenage Magistrates' Court charged with posting revenge porn pictures of her girlfriend on Facebook Photo: National News and Pictures The court heard the couple had since reconciled.
Mitchell was handed a six-week sentence for revenge porn and a two-week sentence for common assault to run concurrently. They were suspended for 18 months.
Mr Iqbal said his client needed help with her anger management and that the Facebook post was an indication of her naivety.
He said: ""It was a silly thing to do but I think it was in the heat of the moment. Emotions can be dangerous some times.""
Revenge porn laws were only introduced in April. So far around a dozen men have been convicted under the legislation in England.
Joanna Coleman deputy chief crown prosecutor for the area said: ""These vengeful crimes are predominantly thought of as being carried out by men. This sentencing will highlight that anyone can be guilty of this offence and regardless of the defendant's gender once reported it will be taken seriously.
""Crimes where an intimate image of an individual is shared without their permission in such a public forum is invasive humiliating and distressing for the victim and leaves them feeling violated.

LinkedIn's iPhone App Sparks Latest Privacy Controversy Over Mobile Devices
Security researchers have discovered a feature on LinkedIn's iPhone and iPad app that sends detailed information from users' calendars to the company's servers without their knowledge or consent.
If iPhone users ""opt-in"" to the app's calendar feature the app automatically sends all of users' calendar entries within a five-day time frame to LinkedIn's servers researchers say. This can include the subject time and location of meetings as well as the names and email addresses of the meeting organizer and attendees. It can also include meeting notes ""which tend to contain highly sensitive information such as conference call details and passcodes"" Yair Amit and Adi Sharabani researchers at Skycure Security said in a blog post Tuesday. As an example they said users may create a ""financial results"" meeting on their calendar and it would be sent to LinkedIn's servers.
The manner in which the app transmits sensitive data is a possible violation of Apple's privacy guidelines the researchers said.
""We are concerned by the fact it collects and sends-out sensitive information about its users without a clear indication and consent"" the researchers said. They were scheduled to present their findings at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday at Tel-Aviv University.
In a blog post Wednesday responding to the findings Joff Redfern head of mobile products at LinkedIn said the app's calendar feature will no longer send data from meeting notes to the app's servers. He said that the changes would be available soon and that the company has added a link so users can learn more about how the calendar data is used.
Redfern said LinkedIn syncs its app's calendar feature with the calendar on users' mobile devices so that people can see the LinkedIn profiles of people they are about to meet. He noted that the company asks users' permission before accessing their calendars and that people can opt-in to the feature. Information from users' calendars is sent securely and not shared or stored on its servers he said.
""Its a great feature"" Redfern said. ""We hope you try it out. If at any time you decide its not for you then you can always go to the mobile apps settings page to turn off the calendar feature.""
The researchers' findings are the latest controversy surrounding mobile apps leaking sensitive data without users' knowledge.
In February a programmer in Singapore revealed that Path a popular new social networking app for the iPhone was uploading users' address books to its servers without users' knowledge. Path later released a new version of the app that asks for permission before uploading the information acknowleding in a blog post ""We made a mistake.""
In December a researcher found hidden software installed on smart phones called Carrier IQ that logged text messages Google searches and phone numbers from about 150 million smart phones and reported them to mobile phone carriers. The researcher's findings sparked calls for investigation in Congress and resulted in a class-action lawsuit against the software's maker Carrier IQ Inc. based in Mountain View Calif.

pri_250_db,130m credit and debit cards stored by heartland pa.txt,"You probably heard about the Target data breach that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of the retail giant's customers into the hands of cybercriminals in late 2013. But Target's security nightmare wasn't the worst data breach in history.
Here are the 10 worst data breaches in history  so far.
Heartland Payment Systems 2008-2009: 130 million records compromised
In early 2009 this Princeton New Jersey-based payment processor announced the largest data breach ever to affect an American company. Heartland's breach exposed information from approximately 130 million credit and debit cards to cybercriminals.
Malware planted on Heartland's network recorded card data as it arrived from retailers. Because the company processed payments for more than 250000 businesses across the country the impact was huge.
In 2010 Albert Gonzalez the convicted mastermind behind the Heartland breach (as well as another huge breach) was sentenced to 20 years in prison  the longest sentence ever handed down for computer crime in a U.S. court.
Target Stores 2013: 110 million records compromised
In December 2013 retail giant Target confirmed that hackers had infected the company's payment-card readers making off with approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers that had been used at Target stores in the United States during the 2013 post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.
In January 2014 Target announced that the contact information  full names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers  of 70 million customers had also been compromised. Some of those customers probably also had credit-card data compromised in the earlier breach but it's possible that as many as 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Sony online entertainment services 2011: 102 million records compromised
In April 2011 attackers whose identities are still unknown targeted the PlayStation Network that links Sony's home gaming consoles as well as Sony Online Entertainment which hosts massively multiplayer online PC games and the Qriocity video- and music-streaming service.
Initially Sony said that only the personal information of 78 million PlayStation Network users  login credentials names addresses phone numbers and email addresses  had been exposed. But the tally of compromised accounts rose by 24.6 million when investigators discovered the attackers had also penetrated SOE and Qriocity. The credit-card data of approximately 23400 SOE users in Europe was also stolen.
Following the initial breach disclosure the PlayStation Network went dark worldwide for more than three weeks. In May 2011 Sony estimated its cleanup costs  which included fighting 65 class-action lawsuits brought against the company  at $171 million.
National Archive and Records Administration 2008: 76 million records compromised
Not all data breaches are the result of criminal activity. In late 2008 a hard drive at the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) stopped working. It held the names contact information and Social Security numbers of 76 million U.S. military veterans.
Instead of being destroyed on-site the drive was sent for repair to a government contractor which determined the drive could not be fixed  so it was sent it out to be scrapped. It is not clear whether the drive was actually destroyed.
Following complaints by an IT manager at NARA an investigation was launched and NARA changed its policies to destroy all malfunctioning storage media containing sensitive personal information.
""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII [personally identifiable information] occurred and therefore does not believe that notification [of the affected veterans] is necessary or appropriate at this time"" the agency told Wired News in 2009.
Anthem 2015: 69 million to 80 million records compromisedIn February 2015 Anthem formerly known as WellPoint and the second-largest health insurer in the U.S. revealed its customer database had been breached. Stolen data included names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers and employment histories  everything an identity thief might need. As many as 80 million current and former customers were thought to be affected.
Epsilon 2011: 60 million to 250 million records compromised
In March 2011 the Texas-based marketing firm Epsilon which handled email communications for more than 2500 clients worldwide  including seven Fortune 10 companies  announced that databases pertaining to about 50 Epsilon clients had been stolen.
Email addresses of at least 60 million customers ended up in the hands of cybercriminals and more than a dozen major retailers banks hotels and other companies were affected including Best Buy JPMorgan Chase Capital One Bank and Verizon.
Epsilon could not confirm exactly how many individuals were affected. Conservative estimates put the number of email addresses stolen at 60 million but according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a San Diego-based nonprofit advocacy group the number may have been as high as 250 million.
Home Depot 2014: 56 million payment cards compromised
In September 2014 hardware and building-supplies warehouse retailer Home Depot admitted what had been suspected for weeks. Beginning in April or May of the same year ""carders"" had infected its point-of-sale systems at stores in the U.S. and Canada with malware that pretended to be antivirus software but instead stole customer credit and debit cards.
The theft may have been the largest haul of payment cards resulting from a direct attack on a retailer if the lower estimate from the TJX breach (see below) is accepted. But unlike the Target theft less than a year earlier the Home Depot theft didn't result in customers staying away nor did it generate quite the same media outcry.
Evernote 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In March 2013 users of the note-taking and archiving service Evernote learned that their email addresses usernames and encrypted passwords had been exposed by a security breach. No financial data was stolen and the company confirmed that none of the user-generated content on its servers had been compromised.
However as had been the case for those affected by Epsilon's 2011 breach Evernote users who had their usernames and email addresses stolen were vulnerable to spam emails and phishing campaigns  some of which pretended to be password-reset emails coming from Evernote itself.
Living Social 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In April 2013 Living Social a daily-deals site partly owned by Amazon announced that the names email addresses birth dates and encrypted passwords of more than 50 million customers worldwide had been stolen by hackers. Twenty million Living Social customers whose information was stored on servers in Asia were not affected.
TJX Companies Inc. 2006-2007: At least 46 million records compromised
When it was discovered in 2007 the TJX data breach was the biggest theft of consumer data ever in the United States affecting the parent company of several major retail brands including Marshalls T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. At least 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period but some estimates put the number at closer to 90 million.
About 450000 TJX customers also had their personally identifiable information stolen including driver's license numbers. The breach ultimately cost the Framingham Massachusetts-based company $256 million.
The TJX hackers included Albert Gonzalez who was cooperating with law-enforcement investigations into earlier data thefts when he took part in both the TJX breach and the even larger Heartland Payment Systems attack two years later.
Honorable mention: Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014: Company's inner workings completely exposed
On Nov. 24 2014 staffers at Sony Pictures Entertainment the movie and television production division of Sony had their computer screens hijacked by a grinning skull. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace said it had taken over the corporate network and would release detailed company information online if unspecified demands weren't met. Within days gigabytes of internal Sony Pictures data appeared on file-sharing sites including Social Security numbers and scanned passports belonging to actors and executives internal passwords unpublished scripts marketing plans financial and legal information and even four entire unreleased Sony movies.
The company's 6800 employees plus an estimated 40000 other individuals the company had paid over previous years were placed at dire risk of identity theft and rival Hollywood studios got a detailed blueprint of Sony Pictures' accounts future plans and internal workings.Some rumors blamed North Korea others disgruntled insiders. Whatever the cause the incident threatened the very survival of Sony Pictures Entertainment as a company and may be the most damaging corporate data breach ever.

Google Play Shares Private Customer Data with Developers in Australia: Report
By Dianna Dilworthon Feb. 13 2013 - 2:04 PMComment
Australian developer Dan Nolan was playing around with his dashboard in Google Play and was surprised to learn that he had access to a number of personal details about his customers.
If you bought the app on Google Play (even if you cancelled the order) I have your email address your suburb and in many instances your full name he explained in a blog post. Each Google Play order is treated as a Google wallet transaction and as such software developers get all of the information (sans exact address) for an order of an app that they would get from the order of something physical.
The shocking thing about this discovery according to Nolan is that Google does not disclose that it is sharing this information with developers to the customers making these purchases. Let me make this crystal clear every App purchase you make on Google Play gives the developer your name suburb and email address with no indication that this information is actually being transferred continues Nolan on his blog.
Googles explains on the Google Play terms of use page you may be required to provide information about yourself such as your name address and billing details. Googlesprivacy policiesexplain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when using Google Play. The policy outlines what kinds of personal data Google collects how it is used for advertising how you can control it but doesnt seem to answer the question as to what Google will be doing with this information if you purchase an app.
Nolan expressed concern that this information would allow developers to go after people who give them bad reviews. (Via ZDNET).

Snapchat Settles FTC Charges That Promises of Disappearing Messages Were False
Snapchat Also Transmitted Users Location and Collected Their Address Books
Snapchat the developer of a popular mobile messaging app has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers
with promises about the disappearing nature of messages sent through the service. The FTC case also alleged that the company deceived consumers over the amount of personal data it collected and the security measures taken to protect that data from misuse and unauthorized disclosure. In fact the case alleges Snapchats failure to secure its Find Friends feature resulted in a security breach that enabled attackers to compile a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers.
According to the FTCs complaint Snapchat made multiple misrepresentations to consumers about its product that stood in stark contrast to how the app actually worked.
If a company markets privacy and security as key selling points in pitching its service to consumers it is critical that it keep those promises said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. Any company that makes misrepresentations to consumers about its privacy and security practices risks FTC action.
Touting the ephemeral nature of snaps the term used to describe photo and video messages sent via the app Snapchat marketed the apps central feature as the users ability to send snaps that would disappear forever"" after the sender-designated time period expired. Despite Snapchats claims the complaint describes several simple ways that recipients could save snaps indefinitely.
Consumers can for example use third-party apps to log into the Snapchat service according to the complaint. Because the services deletion feature only functions in the official Snapchat app recipients can use these widely available third-party apps to view and save snaps indefinitely. Indeed such third-party apps have been downloaded millions of times. Despite a security researcher warning the company about this possibility the complaint alleges Snapchat continued to misrepresent that the sender controls how long a recipient can view a snap.
That Snapchat stored video snaps unencrypted on the recipients device in a location outside the apps sandbox meaning that the videos remained accessible to recipients who simply connected their device to a computer and accessed the video messages through the devices file directory.
That Snapchat deceptively told its users that the sender would be notified if a recipient took a screenshot of a snap. In fact any recipient with an Apple device that has an operating system pre-dating iOS 7 can use a simple method to evade the apps screenshot detection and the app will not notify the sender.
That the company misrepresented its data collection practices. Snapchat transmitted geolocation information from users of its Android app despite saying in its privacy policy that it did not track or access such information.
The complaint also alleges that Snapchat collected iOS users contacts information from their address books without notice or consent. During registration the app prompted users to Enter your mobile number to find your friends on Snapchat! Snapchats privacy policy claimed that the app only collected the users email phone number and Facebook ID for the purpose of finding friends. Despite these representations when iOS users entered their phone number to find friends Snapchat also collected the names and phone numbers of all the contacts in their mobile device address books. Snapchat continued to collect this information without notifying or obtaining users consent until Apple modified its operating system to provide such notice with the introduction of iOS 6.
Finally the FTC alleges that despite the companys claims about taking reasonable security steps Snapchat failed to secure its Find Friends feature.
For example the complaint alleges that numerous consumers complained that they had sent snaps to someone under the false impression that they were communicating with a friend. In fact because Snapchat failed to verify users phone numbers during registration these consumers were actually sending their personal snaps to complete strangers who had registered with phone numbers that did not belong to them.
Moreover as noted above the complaint alleges that Snapchats failure to secure its Find Friends feature resulted in a security breach permitting attackers to compile a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers. According to the FTC the exposure of this information could lead to costly spam phishing and other unsolicited communications.
The settlement with Snapchat is part of the FTCs ongoing effort to ensure that companies market their apps truthfully and keep their privacy promises to consumers. Under the terms of its settlement with the FTC Snapchat will be prohibited from misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy security or confidentiality of users information. In addition the company will be required to implement a comprehensive privacy program that will be monitored by an independent privacy professional for the next 20 years.
This case is part of a multi-national enforcement sweep on mobile app privacy by members of the Global Privacy Enforcement Network a cross-border coalition of privacy enforcement authorities. The case is also coordinated with the Asia Pacific Privacy Priorities forums Privacy Awareness Week.
The Commission vote to accept the consent order for public comment was 5-0.
The FTC will publish a description of the consent agreement package in the Federal Register shortly. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days beginning today and continuing through June 9 2014 after which the Commission will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final. Interested parties can submit written comments electronically or in paper form by following the instructions in the Invitation To Comment part of the Supplementary Information section. Comments in electronic form should be submitted online.
NOTE: The Commission issues an administrative complaint when it has reason to believe that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. When the Commission issues a consent order on a final basis it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $16000.
The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent deceptive and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot stop and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish visit the FTCs online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357).

pri_250_db,"high school student in saratoga, ca, was victim of.txt","Suicide of Audrie Pott - Wikipedia the free encyclopedia
Audrie Pott was a 15-year-old student at Saratoga High School in Saratoga California who committed suicide on September 12 2012. She had been sexually assaulted by three teenage boys at a party eight days earlier and pictures of the assault were posted online with accompanying bullying.[1]
Pott's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have been compared to the suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons a young woman in Dartmouth Nova Scotia appearing to show highly similar characteristics. New laws are being considered as a result of these events.[where?][which?][when?][2][3]
In early September 2012 Pott went to party with about 10 other teenagers who were allegedly drunk.[4] Three or more of these teenagers sexually assaulted Pott. Three boys eventually pled guilty to and served time in juvenile hall for the sexual assault.[5] During the assault photographs were taken and distributed via social network and SMS. In the following days Pott was bullied by some who saw the photographs. On September 12 2012 Pott killed herself by hanging.
In April 2013 three sixteen-year-old boys were arrested in northern California on suspicion of sexual battery to Pott.[1] Pott's parents also filed a lawsuit against the three teenagers and in July 2013 they added a fifteen-year-old girl as a defendant in the suit alleging she was present during the assault and later lied about it to help cover it up.[6]
Three teenage boys admitted in juvenile court to sexually assaulting and possessing photos of Audrie Pott both felonies. Two of the three received 30-day sentences to be served on weekends. The other was sentenced to 45 consecutive days. Because of their ages the three teenagers have not been publicly identified.[7]
A civil case filed by Pott's parents to decide if the boys were responsible for her death was originally set to go to forward to trial in April 2015.[8] The case reached settlement prior to going to trial.[9] As part of the terms of trial two of the boys were required to verbally apologize in open court admit again to the sexual assault admit to their role in the death of Audrie Potts agree to being filmed in a documentary pay a combined $950000 support the petition for an honorary diploma for Audrie Pott and give 10 presentations on sexual assault and sexting.[10]

For many users of Facebook the worlds largest social network it was just the latest in a string of frustrations.
Screenshot courtesy of the Electronic Privacy Information Center
Facebook asks users to link information in their profiles which makes that information public.
Mark Zuckerberg the chief executive of Facebook during a conference last month.
On Wednesday users discovered a glitch that gave them access to supposedly private information in the accounts of their Facebook friends like chat conversations.
Not long before Facebook had introduced changes that essentially forced users to choose between making information about their interests available to anyone or removing it altogether.
Although Facebook quickly moved to close the security hole on Wednesday the breach heightened a feeling among many users that it was becoming hard to trust the service to protect their personal information.
Facebook has become more scary than fun said Jeffrey P. Ament 35 a government contractor who lives in Rockville Md.
Mr. Ament said he was so fed up with Facebook that he deleted his account this week after three years of using the service. Every week there seems to be a new privacy update or change and I just cant keep up with it.
Facebook said it did not think the security hole which was open a few hours would have a lasting impact on the companys reputation.
For a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown that now assists with more than 400 million people sharing billions of pieces of content with their friends and the institutions they care about we think our track record for security and safety is unrivaled said Elliot Schrage the companys vice president for public policy. Are we perfect? Of course not.
Facebook is increasingly finding itself at the center of a tense discussion over privacy and how personal data is used by the Web sites that collect it said James E. Katz a professor of communications at Rutgers University.
Its clear that we keep discovering new boundaries of privacy that are possible to push and just as quickly breached Mr. Katz said.
Social networking experts and analysts wonder whether Facebook is pushing the envelope in a way that could damage its reputation over time. The privacy mishap on Wednesday did not help matters.
While this breach appears to be relatively small its inopportunely timed said Augie Ray an analyst with Forrester Research. It threatens to undermine what Facebook hopes to achieve with its network over the next few years because users have to ask whether it is a platform worthy of their trust.
Over the last few months Facebook has introduced changes that encourage users to make their photos and other information accessible to anyone on the Internet. Last month its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg unveiled plans to begin sharing users information with some outside Web sites and Facebook began prompting users to link information in their profile pages like their hobbies and hometowns in a way that makes that information public.
That last change prompted the Electronic Privacy Information Center an advocacy group to file a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission.
Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes Marc Rotenberg the groups executive director said in a letter to the commission.
The extent of the discontent among users is hard to quantify but one measure is a group created on Facebook to protest the recent changes which has attracted more than 2.2 million members.
Mr. Schrage said that the company was aware that some users were not happy with the changes but that the overall response had been positive.
Part of the reason Facebooks recent changes are upsetting users is that in contrast to a service like Twitter most people signed up for Facebook with the understanding that their information would be available only to an approved circle of friends said Danah Boyd a social media researcher at Microsoft and a fellow at Harvard Universitys Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
Facebook started out with a strong promise of privacy she said. You had to be at a university or some network to sign up. Thats part of how it competed with other social networks by being the anti-MySpace.
As the company has changed its approach to privacy it has introduced new ways for users to adjust their privacy settings. But these tools have grown increasingly convoluted leaving many users frustrated and unsure of what information is available to whom. They say a site that they joined for the sake of friends and fun has started to feel too much like work.
At this point I have no idea how many times Ive changed my settings said Lauren Snead a 24-year-old student in Murfreesboro Tenn. Ive done it so many times. Im tired of logging in one day and seeing everything is different and trying to understand what it means.
In addition many users are not even aware of the privacy settings Ms. Boyd said. A recent survey from Consumer Reports found that 23 percent of Facebook users either did not know the site offered privacy controls or chose not to use them.
Mr. Schrage said the company was working to clear up confusion about the settings.
Many frustrated users may not give up on the site because it has become a vital form of communication. Facebook continues to add users at a rapid clip doubling in size in the last year.
Im not going to quit Facebook because its so ingrained in the culture said Ryan Scannell a 26-year-old food scientist in Chicago. Facebook is not a private place I dont expect it to be. But at the same time Id like to control whats accessible to strangers and whats accessible to family and friends.
There are financial motives behind the companys moves. One of the ways Facebook makes money with its free service is by customizing the selection of advertisements shown to individual users. The more information that users put into their profiles the more the company can make from such focused ads.
In addition analysts say Facebook may be eyeing the lucrative market for online search figuring that its users will be more likely to turn to their friends for advice and information than the wider Web. That opens up more opportunities for advertisers.
Theyre heating up in their battle against Google said Sean Sullivan a security adviser at the Internet security firm F-Secure who analyzes social networks. If Im looking for a day care for my 6-year-old Im going to put that in my status message not do a Google search.
Mr. Schrage of Facebook said the controversy over the sites changes was indicative of a larger shift online.
Facebook has been made the center of attention around a really important issue of how technology is changing the conception of privacy control and sharing he said. People are uneasy about it but as they start to see the benefits and advantages of it they start to see the value of the experiences.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: May 10 2010An article on Thursday about Facebook users privacy concerns referred incorrectly to the type of information the site uses to customize advertising for individual users. It uses both public and private information on the users profile page not public information alone.

pri_250_db,a photo randi zuckerberg shared on facebook ends u.txt,"Is Facebook's Privacy Policy Too Confusing? - US News
The sister of Facebook's founder got tripped up by the privacy settings while posting a private family photo.
Randi Zuckerberg sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg
posted a photo to Facebook which subsequently ended up posted to the Twitter account of the marketing director of Vox Mediaand was then visible to her 40000 followers. Zuckerberg was able to use her status as sister of the founder and former marketing manager for the social networking company to get the photo removed but the incident raises questions as to whether or not Facebook's privacy guidelines are too confusing.
The family photo posted by Zuckerberg showed up on the newsfeed of Vox Media's Callie Schweitzer because they have a mutual friend but Zuckerberg did not intend for the photo to become public. She said it was ""way uncool"" for Schweitzer to post the private photo to Twitter.
""Digital etiquette: always ask permission before posting a friend's photo publicly. It's not about privacy settings it's about human decency"" Zuckerberg wrote afterwards on Twitter.
Schweitzer deleted the photo and apologized for reposting what she thought was public content.
Some say Scheweitzer didn't do anything wrong and Zuckerberg was at fault for not understanding who she was sharing her photo with. Gawker's Mario Aguilar for example writes:
But hold the phone Callie! Don't apologize. Doesn't Randi Zuckerberg understand her privacy settings and how a photo on Facebook might suddenly fly out of her control? She's merely compromising her personal desires for the forward march of Facebook's benevolent reign and the advancement of the new
newsocial-media contract. No comprende? That's her problem.
Facebook has been criticized for its often changing and vague privacy guidelines with users complaining that it is too difficult to tell which of their friends can see what pieces of content they post. For example photo albums can be set to public so everyone can see them or restricted to only friends or further restricted to some friends and not others. The changing controls can make it difficult for users to determine which they've selected.
Facebook is rolling out new privacy settings and past confusion has been such that
Gizmodo published a guide detailing steps users should take to ensure they know who can see what and that they aren't sharing anything they don't want to be.
Is Facebook's privacy policy too confusing? Take the poll and comment below.
This poll is now closed but the debate continues in the comments section.

COMMENTEMAILMORESAN FRANCISCO A hacker has acquired the records of 15 million T-Mobile customers and people who had applied for credit the company reported Thursday.The breach which affected two years worth of recordsoccurred at Experian the vendor that processes T-Mobile's credit applications T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a post on the site.Experian North Americasaid in a noticethat one of its business units was compromised but that its consumer credit bureau was not affected.Experian has notified both U.S. and international law enforcement. Experian North America's parent company Experianis headquartered in Dublin Ireland.""The investigation is ongoing but what we know right now is that the hacker acquired the records of approximately 15 million people including new applicants requiring a credit check for service or device financing from September 1 2013 through September 16 2015"" Legere wrote.""The data set was for applicants and customers of T-Mobile who applied for service over that two year period"" said Experian spokeswoman Susan Henson.The breachhappened approximatelytwo weeks ago. It ""was discovered within two days secured immediately comprehensive forensic investigation launched (and still continuing) and we announced it today to quickly notify consumers. Our notification to state attorneys general happens tomorrow"" Henseon said.In a refreshing change from the corporate-speak often used by CEOs whose businesses are breached T-Mobile's Legere stayed true to form with his directness.""Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach"" he said saying he would conduct a ""thorough review"" of his company's relationship with Experian but that his top concern for now was ""assisting any and all consumers affected.""The compromised information includes customers'names addresses and birth datesas well as encrypted fields with Social Security number and ID number which could be a drivers license or passport number.Experian told T-Mobile the encryption protecting those numbers may have been compromised Legere said.Experian and T-Mobile have set up two years of free credit monitoring and identity resolution services for compromised customers. Ironically the service is being offeredthrough Experian's own credit monitoring service.Experian cautioned consumers that under no circumstances would either Experian or T-Mobile call them or send them messages asking forpersonal information in connection with the breach.""You may go to the website but you should not provide personal information to anyone who calls you or sends you a message about this incident"" Experian said in a statement.Follow USA TODAY reporter Elizabeth Weise on Twitter: @eweise.

PARIS  With the European debate over the use of body scanners at airports intensifying the French government said Friday that it would begin putting a handful of the scanners into place for testing at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports to use for American-bound flights.
Europe Debates Use of Full-Body Scanners at Airports (January 8 2010)
French officials said that one would be installed at Charles de Gaulle by the end of January and that five or six more would be introduced there and at Orly over the following weeks.
The body scans  which will complement metal-detection and baggage X-ray devices  will not be mandatory said Alexandre Crozat director of the office of security measures at Frances civil aviation authority but passengers who refuse them will be required to undergo pat-down searches. He did not say how long the scanners would be tested. The failed attempt to bring down a plane flying from Amsterdam to Detroit on Dec. 25 has raised security concerns at airports around the world. On Thursday President Obama directed the Homeland Security Department to speed the installation of body scanners at American airports and to work with international airports to see that they upgrade their own equipment.
But European governments are sharply divided about the scanners which allow security agents to see virtually naked images of passengers. Many officials and privacy advocates express deep concerns that the process is overly intrusive. The technology is also expensive: the machines cost about $190000 apiece.On Thursday a committee of European Union aviation safety experts agreed in a closed-door meeting in Brussels on the need for a unified approach to enhancing security but it was clear that they were divided on what role the scanners should have. Belgiums secretary of state for transportation Etienne Schouppe has described them as excessive. Spain and Germany have also expressed strong reservations.Britain meanwhile plans to introduce body scanners in its airports by the end of the month; tests have begun at Heathrow in London and at airports in Manchester and other sites. Italy has also said it will use the technology.Sophie in t Veld a Dutch member of the European Parliament and an expert on privacy issues expressed concern that some member states were rushing to use scanners without first allowing for a thoughtful public debate. These are ad hoc measures without the governments having any clear idea of what exactly they are trying to achieve she said Friday in a telephone interview.I understand that the public is clamoring for instant solutions Ms. in t Veld said. Scanners and other technologies can be very useful tools in the fight against terrorism but they are no more than that. Ideally people with bad intentions should be identified long before they pass through an airports final security checkpoint she said.The suspect in the thwarted bombing last month flew from Ghana to Nigeria to the Netherlands boarding the flight to Detroit at Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam. In the days after the attack was foiled the United States and the Netherlands pointed fingers at each other over why the airport which has 15 of the scanners had not been using them. Dutch authorities said that Washington had not given permission while the American authorities said no such permission was necessary.In any case the Dutch announced within days that the scanners would be used for all United States-bound flights from Schiphol by the end of the month.

pri_250_db,the us supreme court upholds the practice of intru.txt,"Justices Uphold Background Checks - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
WASHINGTON  Employees of government contractors including scientists and engineers who work on government space programs must submit to intrusive background checks if they want to keep their jobs the Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Wednesday.
Federal employees have long been required to submit to background checks. In 2004 after
a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission the requirement was extended to employees of government contractors.Twenty-eight employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory a NASA center operated by the California Institute of Technology sued saying the checks would violate their constitutional right to informational privacy. The employees worked on civilian space missions and research.In 2008 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provisionally agreed with the employees ordering parts of the government background checks halted while their case went forward.
Supreme Court Asks if Companies Have Privacy RightsJAN. 19 2011
The court said that two kinds of questions in the government forms raised constitutional concerns. The employees were asked about drug use and counseling and they were required to sign a form authorizing the government to collect information from schools landlords employers and others.That additional information was sought through another form this one soliciting adverse information including violations of the law financial integrity abuse of alcohol and/or drugs and mental or emotional stability. There was also a space on the form that invited derogatory as well as positive information.Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case because she had worked on it as solicitor general.In an opinion for six justices Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he assumed for purposes of the decision that a constitutional right to avoid disclosing personal information exists but he did not say what part of the Constitution it was grounded in or what kinds of information it covered. He did say that the information sought here did not violate whatever such right may exist.The question about drug treatment and counseling Justice Alito wrote was part of a reasonable and indeed a humane approach.The government recognizing that illegal drug use is both a criminal and a medical issue seeks to separate out those illegal drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems he wrote.The open-ended questions directed to the employees references Justice Alito said are an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones. Such questions are commonly used by both public and private employers he added.In addition to finding the questions reasonable Justice Alito said that the plaintiffs privacy concerns should be allayed because the Privacy Act imposes strict restrictions on how the government could use the information it obtained.Justice Antonin Scalia writing for himself and Justice Clarence Thomas issued a caustic concurrence. He said he of course agreed with the result in the case saying the plaintiffs objections to the background checks were ridiculous.
The contention that a right deeply rooted in our history and tradition bars the government from ensuring that the Hubble telescope is not used by recovering drug addicts is he said farcical.But Justice Scalia aimed his harshest criticism at the six justices who signed the majority opinion returning to a theme he pressed last year  that the court is violating its duty and harming its reputation in issuing vague decisions.Whatever the virtues of judicial minimalism he wrote it cannot justify judicial incoherence.The majority opinion he continued provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts and will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits claiming violations of the right to informational privacy. Though the court ruled against the plaintiffs he said the majority opinion amounts to a generous gift to the plaintiffs bar.Justice Scalia said he would have taken a simpler approach in the case NASA v. Nelson No. 09-530.I would simply hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy Justice Scalia wrote.Like many other desirable things not included in the Constitution he wrote informational privacy seems liked a good idea. But he said it should be enacted through legislation rather than imposed by judges through constitutional interpretation.Justice Alito in response said there were good reasons for failing to provide a definitive answer to the threshold question in the case.The government in defending the suit had not asked the court to reject a right to informational privacy. It is undesirable Justice Alito wrote for us to decide a matter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit of briefing by the parties.

ICO investigating 56 Dean Street clinic for disclosing details of 780 HIV patients in data breach
A data breach at of the leading sexual health clinics in Britain has revealed the names and contact details of almost 800 HIV positive patients.
The 56 Dean Street clinic in London part of the Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust accidentally disclosed the information when an email newsletter for the clinic's Option E online service was sent out en masse rather than to individual recipients.
ICO granted new powers to audit NHS organisations for data protection
ICO to examine data protection and privacy implications of connected medical devices
Names and email addresses of the 780 recipients of the list were not hidden in the email. The incident represents a massive breach of patient privacy.
The privacy breach is suspected to be one of the biggest of its kind and is already being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
""We are aware of an incident regarding the 56 Dean Street clinic and are making enquiries"" an ICO spokesperson told Computing.
The clinic has already stated that it is examining how the breach occurred with a ""human mistake"" thought to be the cause.
56 Dean Street clinic has apologised to patients affected by the breach and set up a helpline to aid those who have had their privacy breached.
""I'm writing to apologise to you. This morning at around 11.30am at we sent you the latest edition of OptionE newsletter"" Dr Alan McOwan Chelsea and Westminster hospital NHS Trust's director for sexual health wrote in an email to patients.
""This is normally sent to individuals on an individual basis but unfortunately we sent out today's email to a group of email addresses. We apologise for this error"" he said.
""We recalled/deleted the email as soon as we realised what had happened"" Dr McOwan continued adding ""If it is still in your inbox please delete it immediately.""
""Clearly this is completely unacceptable. We are urgently investigating how this has happened and I promise you that we will take steps to ensure it never happens again. We will send you the outcome of the investigation"" he concluded.
Complaints about the breach have already been made to the NHS patient advice and liaison service on behalf of those who've been affected.
""This is serious breach of data protection. There are several names I recognise from the list and while I am of course being discreet I am not sure I trust every other person on the list to do the same"" Elliot Herman from London wrote in an email of complaint seen by The Guardian.
""I feel bad making this complaint because I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the excellent service provided by the clinic and my own doctor Alan McOwan who has always provided superb clinical care. I have never had cause to complain in the past. However I feel this is important enough to bring to official attention"" he added.

PHILADELPHIA (AP)  A Pennsylvania school district accused of secretly switching on laptop computer cameras inside students homes is under investigation by federal authorities a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case said.The F.B.I. will look into whether any federal wiretap or computer-intrusion laws were violated by Lower Merion School District said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.On Friday days after a student filed a federal lawsuit over the practice district officials acknowledged that they had remotely activated Webcams on school-issued laptops 42 times in the past 14 months to find missing computers. They said they never did so to spy on students.In the paperwork students signed when they got the computers families were not told that the Webcams could be activated in their homes without permission said Doug Young a
district spokesman. Its clear what was in place was insufficient and thats unacceptable he said.The district has suspended the practice amid the lawsuit and the accompanying protests by students the community and privacy advocates Mr. Young said.Risa Vetri Ferman the Montgomery County district attorney said Friday that she might also investigate.Lower Merion a Philadelphia suburb issues Apple laptops to all 2300 students at its two high schools. Only two employees
were authorized to activate the cameras  and only to locate missing laptops Mr. Young said.

pri_250_db,police departments are building dna databases of p.txt,"Police Agencies Are Assembling Records of DNA - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
Detective Mark Kelly of the Bensalem Pa. Township Police demonstrating a DNA test on a steering wheel.
Slowly and largely under the radar a growing number of local law enforcement agencies across the country have moved into what had previously been the domain of the F.B.I. and state crime labs  amassing their own DNA databases of potential suspects some collected with the donors knowledge and some without it.
And that trend  coming at a time of heightened privacy concerns after recent revelations of secret federal surveillance of telephone calls and Internet traffic  is expected only to accelerate after the Supreme Courts recent decision upholding a Maryland statute allowing the authorities to collect DNA samples from those arrested for serious crimes.
These local databases operate under their own rules providing the police much more leeway than state and federal regulations. And the police sometimes collect samples from far more than those convicted of or arrested for serious offenses  in some cases innocent victims of crimes who do not necessarily realize their DNA will be saved for future searches.
New York City has amassed a database with the profiles of 11000 crime suspects. In Orange County Calif. the district attorneys office has 90000 profiles many obtained from low-level defendants who give DNA as part of a plea bargain or in return for having the charges against them dropped. In Central Florida several law enforcement agencies have pooled their DNA databases. A Baltimore database contains DNA from more than 3000 homicide victims.These law enforcement agencies are no longer content to rely solely on the highly regulated network of state and federal DNA databases which have been more than two decades in the making and represent one of the most significant developments in the history of law enforcement in this country.The reasons vary. Some police chiefs are frustrated with the time it can take for state crime labs to test evidence and enter DNA profiles into the existing databases. Others want to compile DNA profiles from suspects or low-level offenders long before their DNA might be captured by the state or national databases which typically require conviction or arrest.
Unfortunately what goes into the national database are mostly reference swabs of people who are going to prison said Jay Whitt of the company DNA:SI Labs which sells DNA testing and database services to police departments. Theyre not the ones were dealing with day in day out the ones still on the street just slipping under the radar.The rise in these local databases has aroused concerns among some critics worried about both the lax rules governing them and the privacy issues they raise.We have been warning law enforcement that when public attention began to focus on these rogue unregulated databases people would be disturbed said Barry Scheck a co-director of the Innocence Project which seeks to exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners. Law enforcement has just gone ahead and started collecting DNA samples from suspects in an unregulated fashion.
For their part law enforcement officials say that the crime-solving benefits of local databases are dramatic.Our take is that its good for law enforcement and good for the community said Doug Muldoon police chief of Palm Bay a city of about 100000 in Central Florida about its database which has produced 1000 matches. He said his officers could now use DNA to address the crime conditions in our community  property crimes and burglaries. State crime labs can take months to analyze evidence from low-level felonies like that he said.As local authorities devise their own policies they are increasingly taking DNA from people on the mere suspicion of a crime long before any arrest and holding on to it regardless of the outcome. Often detectives get DNA samples simply by asking suspects for them.Other times investigators take DNA surreptitiously from discarded trash. Or the DNA might originate from a warrant issued in a specific case authorizing the authorities to compare it against crime scene evidence  with the resulting profile then stored in a database for future use.In some jurisdictions it is not only suspects whose DNA goes into the database but occasionally victims too.
If an officer goes to your house on a burglary they will swab a door handle and then they will ask Can we get a sample from the homeowner so we can eliminate them as the source? Chief Muldoon said. They say Sure.The homeowners sample goes into the database too Chief Muldoon said. In many jurisdictions so would samples from others even briefly considered potential suspects.Thats so profoundly disturbing  that you would give DNA to the police to clear yourself and then once cleared the police use it to investigate you for other crimes and retain it indefinitely said Stephen B. Mercer the chief attorney of the forensics division of the Maryland public defenders office and one of the lawyers involved in the case that resulted in the recent Supreme Court decision on DNA. If that doesnt strike at a core value of privacy I dont know what does.The Supreme Courts decision last week in Maryland v. King was its first to squarely address DNA collection and databanking. While that decision said nothing explicit about the authority of local law enforcement to keep DNA databases it could well encourage local jurisdictions to push ahead several experts said.In light of the Supreme Court decision more and more organizations are going to be doing this said Frederick Harran the public safety director in Bensalem Township a Philadelphia suburb that is aggressively building its own DNA database.
The courts decision readily accepted the utility of DNA collection as a routine station house booking procedure comparing it to fingerprinting.King is a green light said Erin E. Murphy a New York University law professor who has written about DNA databases and DNA profiling. Its a ringing endorsement of DNA testing and many law enforcement agencies would see this as a dramatic opportunity to expand DNA collection.
It is not clear how many local jurisdictions maintain DNA databases. DNA SI Labs provides databanks for nine police departments including those in Bensalem and Palm Bay Mr. Whitt said and has contracts with a dozen other departments to build more.Palm Bay shares its database of 15000 profiles with nearby departments creating a regional pool. It is more common for prosecutors the police and local crime labs to maintain their own DNA data typically from suspects which may be ineligible for upload to the national database.Few states have laws regarding local DNA databases. Alaska prohibits them. California and Hawaii are explicit in not precluding them. In many states including New York the law is silent on the issue. And there is little consensus about what DNA retention policies are appropriate at the local level.There really are no rules as to what you can specifically keep said Jill Spriggs who runs the Sacramento district attorneys crime lab. The forensic community is all over the board.The issues raised by these local databases include what type of DNA testing should be permitted. In Denver which keeps a local database the district attorney Mitchell R. Morrissey is a leading proponent of familial DNA searching. The technique uses special software not to identify matches but for clues as to whether a relative of a person whose DNA is on file may be the source of crime scene DNA.
Because local databases operate without the stricter rules governing federal and local ones local authorities have been able to set the pace for how DNA is collected and used in criminal investigations. That pace experts say could accelerate if rapid DNA testing devices capable of quickly developing DNA profiles from samples are deployed in station houses.The ability to very quickly generate DNA profiles experts say could provide a greater incentive for local authorities to build and maintain their own database.Mentioned in last weeks Supreme Court opinion such technology is not yet generally in the hands of law enforcement although the Palm Bay Police Department is field testing one such device.

Blippy Users' Credit Card Numbers Exposed in Google Search Results
Update: Blippy has explained how the credit card numbers ended up in Google.
Sharing your credit card and online purchases with friends on the web sounds risky and it is. We've just discovered that several credit card transactions shared on social networking site Blippy have been exposed  with full credit card numbers included  in Google search results.
Tipster Trey Copeland wrote to us with a link to results for the search: site:blippy.com +""from card"". That search returns results showing detailed purchase information for transactions. Each result highlights that there was a ""debit card transaction"" or ""card transaction"" the amount spent the specific location (address included) and the full card number (as seen below).
Blippy users who share their credit card and bank account information do so with the assumption that this information will remain private. Blippy addresses security concerns with the following statement on its website:
""Blippy is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.""
Unfortunately it appears that there is a bug in the ""administrative physical and electronic measures"" that ensure privacy as Blippy's security system has been breached in a very public and unfortunate way.
Given the breach we suggest that Blippy users who have authorized the site to access their debit or credit transactions take immediate action to revoke access. We've e-mailed Blippy notified of them of the situation and will update this post when we know more.

A sordid orgy and why Max Mosley can't be allowed to erase history
A sordid orgy and why Max Mosley can't be allowed to erase history
More than any man on earth the former Formula One racing chief Max Mosley is trying to rewrite the rules that have governed the workings of a free Press for many years not just in this country but throughout Europe.His latest assault is on the internet giant Google. He has been trying to persuade a French court that the web engine should be prevented from directing users to pictures of a private orgy that he organised five years ago.The photographs involving Mr Mosley and five consensual prostitutes were originally published by the now defunct News of the World in March 2008. It alleged that Mr Mosley had been engaged in a sick Nazi orgy.
Mr Mosley has been trying to persuade a French court that Google should be prevented from directing users to pictures of a private orgy that he organised five years ago
Google's response to Mr Mosley is that the application of filters would amount to a form of censorship
To the astonishment of many three months later Mr Mosley won damages of 60000 in the High Court from the paper which was held to have invaded his privacy. Although German was spoken uniforms worn and blood was shed by Mosley during the proceedings and despite heads apparently being inspected as though for lice the learned judge declared there was no evidence that this had been a Nazi orgy.Mr Justice Eady ruled that if it had been a Nazi orgy he might have found in favour of the newspaper since Mr Mosley was a public figure of sorts whose suitability for his high-profile job would have been seriously called into question by such antics. As there was no such proof the paper was required to pay damages and costs.Buoyed by this significant (and to my mind irrational) verdict Mr Mosley set about trying to restrict the activities of the Press. In 2011 he argued in the European Court of Human Rights that prior notification should be compulsory for newspapers to give their targets time to obtain an injunction preventing publication.
(left to right) Woman D Woman B and Woman C above and a fourth Woman A all denied there was any Nazi element to the orgy at the trial against the News of The World
In other words a politician or businessman caught doing something wrong could try to persuade a sympathetic judge to kill off the story. Mercifully the Court had a fit of good sense and seven of its judges ruled that the right to freedom of expression would be at risk if pre-notification was compulsory.But Mr Mosley was and is a man obsessed. One way or another the Press must be curbed. His lawyers have just argued in front of French judges that Google should apply filters so that people would be unable to access photographs of his orgy.
If Mr Mosley had his way it would not be long before George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four became one step closer to reality
The unwary might suppose that this is perfectly reasonable. If the News of the World was according to an English judge guilty of invading Mr Mosleys privacy when it originally published photographs of his orgy why should those photographs be available on the net?Googles response is that the application of filters would amount to a form of censorship. Access to news sites carrying the pictures or to innocuous articles containing the images might be blocked. In short the prohibition would extend much further than the photographs.If anything Google is understating the case. Should Mr Mosley get his way the consequence could be the rewriting or erasing of chunks of history. Whether or not his privacy was invaded the photographs exist and no one has challenged their authenticity. They amount to a historical record of a sordid event which indubitably took place. Decent people might wish that it hadnt but it did.These images continue to exist not only on the net but in libraries and private homes. If they were wiped out on the internet  actually they physically cant be but access to them can be denied  they would logically have to be destroyed wherever else they might survive. That sounds like a police state.If Mr Mosley wins this battle his next step might be to request that any articles which so much as referred to the pictures of his orgy or the orgy itself should also be destroyed possibly including this one.
Mr Mosley pictured here with F1 models in Barcelona faced calls for his resignation when the story was published
want to rewrite their pasts would also apply to have access blocked to
discreditable information about them on the internet. In fact its
European Unions highest court is considering whether Spains privacy
regulator may have overstepped the mark when trying to force Google to
remove unflattering search results for numerous citizens  for example a
doctor who claimed that a 1991 news article about a dispute with a
patient had damaged his business.Of course libellous or untrue articles can and should be taken off the net. Google says it has removed hundreds of such pages relating to Mr Mosley following requests from him.Equally the search engine should do much more to block access to extreme pornographic websites. But such a welcome move does not involve the rewriting of history to which Mr Mosleys innovations would lead us.
Steve Coogan Hugh Grant and Max Mosley give evidence to the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions: Though he has denied giving donations to Hacked Off the pressure group campaigning for tougher regulation of British newspapers he is a supporter of the organisation
long before George Orwells Nineteen Eighty-Four became one step closer
to reality. In that book Winston Smith is employed as a clerk in the
Ministry of Truth rewriting historical documents to match the
STEPHEN GLOVER: Boris must emulate his hero Churchill's courage and lead the 'Out' campaign - or forget about ever being PM

STEPHEN GLOVER: Meddling and obsessed with secrecy - when Charles is king his enemies will have his head
STEPHEN GLOVER: Why should we have to fill in FOUR tax returns a year when giant firms don't pay a penny?
I exaggerate? I dont think so. Mr Mosley does not like freedom much.
At a meeting of a Commons select committee in March he shocked
observers. He suggested that access to foreign-based websites could be
blocked if they flouted tough new rules that might be introduced by
British regulators. Thats what they do in dictatorships such as Iran
and China.Its surely no accident that Mr Mosley should have started his assault on freedom in France a country with ferocious privacy laws in which newspapers are traditionally cowed by politicians and the courts.Until shortly before his death French newspapers did not dare reveal the truth about the war record private life and financial misdemeanours of former president Francois Mitterrand.For example there was scant discussion of the period during the early years of World War II when he supported Petains pro-German Vichy regime and allegations that he protected Nazi collaborators who helped deport French Jews to death camps were also downplayed. It was only in the months before his death that the Press revealed that Mitterrand had fathered an illegitimate child by a secret mistress.The French court will deliver its verdict on Mr Mosleys latest legal challenge subject to appeal on October 21. Meanwhile he is also challenging Google in the German courts. He is aiming for Europe-wide controls on the web engine  and of course he has lots of money.Though he has denied giving donations to Hacked Off the pressure group campaigning for tougher regulation of British newspapers he is a supporter of the organisation and has reportedly financed hacking victims lawyers. Will Hacked Off now condemn him for wishing to censor the internet? Of course not. What Mr Mosley yearns for Hacked Off also wants.He is a very wealthy man who organised a sordid orgy which the News of the World could have justly described as German-themed. Nevertheless he won his case. Meanwhile that newspaper has been closed down for unconnected reasons.But that is not enough for him. His war of vengeance against the Press continues. It as if newspapers must suffer because he has been damaged.He blames everyone except himself. It seems never to occur to Max Mosley that he may have acted unwisely or wrongly. In trying to bury his unwholesome past this peculiar man would if he could cheerfully dismantle all our freedoms.

LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORETampa Florida -- A data breach at a local hospital had nearly 700 patients' private information stolen.
It happened at Tampa General Hospital.The hospital takes responsibility and says it has fired an employee accused of printing off 675 ""face sheets.""Face sheets are like cover sheets which include names addresses DOB's and social security numbers.
The patients affected were those scheduled for surgeries between Oct. 3 2011 and Aug. 7 2014.The hospital says it educates its staff on the importance of patient information.""It's kind of sickening when one of our own violates that trust"" said John Dunn TGH's spokesperson.
""We will do everything in our power to make sure people understand the importance.""It was Tampa Police who alerted the hospital last month on August 14.
Officers arrested someone unrelated to the hospital and that person had four of those face sheets with him.Some of the face sheets included social security numbers.
TGH launched its own investigation; through its software it tracked the unauthorized access.
Dunn said it invests in patient information security.
Each year three outside agencies examine and test the security against these type of threats.The hospital has alerted each targeted patient.
They have also given one-year of free credit monitoring to those patients who had their social security number accessed. You can also call the dedicated call center at TGH with any questions if you believe you are affected and have not received a letter by Sept. 30. The number is 1-877-202-4625 and is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.MORE:Notice for TGH patients regarding privacy incidentPatients who were affected may reach the Tampa Police Department at 813-354-6600.

Verizon Injecting Perma-Cookies to Track Mobile Customers Bypassing Privacy Controls
Verizon users might want to start looking for another provider. In an effort to better serve advertisers Verizon Wireless has been silently modifying its users' web traffic on its network to inject a cookie-like tracker. This tracker included in an HTTP header called X-UIDH is sent to every unencrypted website a Verizon customer visits from a mobile device. It allows third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep permanent profile of visitors' web browsing habits without their consent.Verizon apparently created this mechanism to expand their advertising programs but it has privacy implications far beyond those programs. Indeed while we're concerned about Verizon's own use of the header we're even more worried about what it allows others to find out about Verizon users. The X-UIDH header effectively reinvents the cookie but does so in a way that is shockingly insecure and dangerous to your privacy. Worse still Verizon doesn't let users turn off this ""feature."" In fact it functions even if you use a private browsing mode or clear your cookies. You can test whether the header is injected in your traffic by visiting lessonslearned.org/sniffor amibeingtracked.comover a cell data connection.How X-UIDH Works and Why It's a ProblemLike a cookie this header uniquely identifies users to the websites they visit. Verizon adds the header at the network level between the user's device and the servers with which the user interacts. Unlike a cookie the header is tied to a data plan so anyone who browses the web through a hotspot or shares a computer that uses cellular data gets the same X-UIDH header as everyone else using that hotspot or computer. That means advertisers may build a profile that reveals private browsing activity to coworkers friends or family through targeted advertising.Also unlike a cookie Verizon's header is nearly invisible to the user and can't be seen or changed in the device's browser settings. If a user clears their cookies the X-UIDH header remains unchanged. Worse ad networks can immediately assign new cookies and link them to the cleared cookies using the unchanged X-UIDH value. We don't know which data brokers and ad networks are using the header to create behavioral profiles but Cory Dunne found at least one GitHub repository contained code to extract the header value as of October 27. The repository has since been quietly deleted but can be viewed at the Internet Archive. Twitter's mobile advertising division also appears to use the header for ad auctions.Besides cookie clearing the X-UIDH header bypasses several other built-in browser privacy mechanisms. Cookies belong to a single website and aren't shared with other websites. But one unique X-UIDH header value is shared with all unencrypted websites a user visits making it easier for ad networks to track that user across many sites in a way not possible with cookies alone. Browsers provide Incognito Mode or Private Browsing Mode in order to defeat some kinds of tracking but the X-UIDH header since it is injected at the network layer ignores those modes. Verizon also chooses to ignore Do Not Track a setting users enable in their browser to indicate they do not want to be tracked. Similarly disabling third-party cookies in browser settings does nothing to stop the X-UIDH header.To compound the problem the header also affects more than just web browsers. Mobile apps that send HTTP requests will also have the header inserted. This means that users' behavior in apps can be correlated with their behavior on the web which would be difficult or impossible without the header. Verizon describes this as a key benefit of using their system. But Verizon bypasses the 'Limit Ad Tracking' settings in iOS and Android that are specifically intended to limit abuse of unique identifiers by mobile apps.Because the header is injected at the network level Verizon can add it to anyone using their towers even those who aren't Verizon customers. Notably Verizon appears to inject the X-UIDH header even for customers of Straight Talk a mobile network reseller (known as a MVNO) that uses Verizon's network. Customers of Straight Talk don't necessarily have a relationship with Verizon.But according to AdAge ""Corporate and government subscribers are excluded from the new marketing solution."" We haven't verified (and Verizon refuses to say) whether the header is still sent for those subscribers or not. If they are indeed excepted from the program that indicates to us that implementing an opt-out is feasible. We're disappointed that Verizon takes some of its users' privacy more seriously than others.Verizon's Claimed ProtectionsVerizon does provide a sort of limited opt-out for individual customers but it appears that the opt-out does not actually disable the header. Instead it merely tells Verizon not to share detailed demographic information with advertisers who present a UIDH value. Meaningful protection from tracking by third parties would require Verizon to omit the header entirely.According to Verizon the header value is a salted hash and the hash changes on an undisclosed frequency. However it's easy for third-party ad networks to create a continuous profile by associating old and new X-UIDH values through their own identifier cookie1. Verizon has refused to say what identifier they hash to create the identifier but their recent patent suggests hashing a phone number. If they are indeed hashing phone numbers it would be a major cryptographic mistake. Phone numbers can easily be deduced from hashes so sending those hashes to untrusted web sites is practically equivalent to giving them your phone number.Besides the ad networks the unique X-UIDH header is a boon to eavesdroppers. We have seen that the NSA uses similar identifying metadata as 'selectors' to collect all of a single person's Internet activity. They also have been shown to use selectors to choose targets for delivering malware via QUANTUMINSERT and similar programs. Having all Verizon mobile users' web traffic marked with a persistent unique identifier makes it trivial for anyone passively eavesdropping on the Internet to associate that traffic with the individual user in a way not possible with IP addresses alone.According to Verizon it began the Precision Market Insights program in 2012 but has consistently refused to provide technical details about how the program worked. The injection of the X-UIDH header went largely unremarked by the technical community until recently because it is so hard to observe. The header is inserted in requests after they leave the phone so customers cannot detect it using only a phone. In order to detect it a user needs to run a web server configured to log or echo all HTTP headers which is very rare.How You Can Protect YourselfVerizon can only modify plaintext traffic. It can't modify encrypted requests without breaking the whole connection. There are four options for encrypting web requests: HTTPS an encrypted proxy a VPN or Tor. Only a VPN or Tor provide full protection in this case.The best protection against this specific problem is to use a VPN that encrypts all requests made from your phone regardless of whether they were made by an app or a browser. Most VPNs are paid services and when using a VPN you have to trust the VPN operators the same way you would normally trust your ISP. Advanced users can also use Tor via Orbot Android app in transparent proxy mode (requires root). Tor is free but you have to trust exit node operators not to interfere with your connection. Tor is more appropriate if you are trying to be anonymous.The second-best protection is to use an encrypted proxy which protects browser traffic but not mobile apps. Mobile Chrome provides the 'Reduce data usage' setting which is reported to prevent the X-UIDH header injection. Unfortunately this connection is not reliably encrypted because an ISP can disable encryption on it at any time.HTTPS which is the best protection for many types of harm is actually the least powerful protection for this one. The header cannot be injected into an HTTPS request but since websites choose whether to offer HTTPS a site that wants to track users can simply avoid HTTPS and get the tracking headers. The web needs to become fully encrypted and these X-UIDH headers provide a strong disincentive for sites and advertisers who wish to track their users to adopt HTTPS. In fact the AT&T patent on similar headers recommends downgrading (redirecting) secure HTTPS requests to HTTP ones in order to receive the tracking header.What Verizon Should DoVerizon should immediately stop injecting the X-UIDH tracking header into its users' traffic. It is entirely possible to re-design their marketing programs so that the header is only injected for users who explicitly consent to having their Internet connections modified to add tracking information and to do so in a way that doesn't allow third-party sites to track users across the Internet.We're also concerned that Verizon's failure to permit its users to opt out of X-UIDH may be a violation of the federal law that requires phone companies to maintain the confidentiality of their customers' data. Only two months ago the wireline sector of Verizon's business was hit with a $7.4 million fine by the Federal Communications Commission after it was caught using its ""customers' personal information for thousands of marketing campaigns without even giving them the choice to opt out."" With this header it looks like Verizon lets its customers opt out of the marketing side of the program but not from the disclosure of their browsing habits.More generally Verizon should stop tampering with their customers' Internet traffic without their customers' consent. ISPs like Verizon act as trusted connectors to the world and shouldn't be modifying our communications on their way to the Internet. People should not be required to subscribe to a VPN and put their trust in a third party in order to get a modicum of privacy on the Internet.AT&T has been reported to be testing a similar header.
1. For instance suppose an ad network assigned you a cookie with the unique value ""cookie1"" and Verizon assigned you the X-UIDH header ""old_uid."" When Verizon changes your X-UIDH header to a new value say ""new_uid"" the ad network can connect ""new_uid"" and ""old_uid"" to the same cookie value ""cookie1"" and see that they all three values represent the same person. Similarly if you subsequently clear cookies the ad network will assign a new cookie value ""cookie2."" Since your X-UIDH value is the same (say ""new_uid"") before and after clearing cookies the ad network can connect ""cookie1"" and ""cookie2"" to the same X-UIDH value ""new_uid."" The back-and-forth bootstrapping of identity makes it impossible to truly clear your tracking history while the X-UIDH header is enabled.

Asia Pacific|U.S. Presses Pakistan for More Data on Travelers
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is increasing pressure on Pakistan to provide the United States with much broader airline passenger information a crucial tool that American investigators use to track terrorist travel patterns but a step that Pakistan has resisted American officials said Sunday.
Pakistan like other countries currently provides the names of airline passengers traveling to the United States. But the administration is pressing for information on Pakistanis who fly to other countries to feed into databases that can detect patterns used by terrorists their financiers logisticians and others who support them the officials said.Pakistan has for several years rebuffed this politically unpopular request as an invasion of its citizens privacy. But the issue is now on a short list of sticking points between the two countries  including some classified counterterrorism programs a long-running dispute over granting visas to American government workers and contractors in Pakistan and enhanced intelligence sharing  that have intensified since the failed Times Square car bombing on May 1 two senior administration officials said. The two officials and several others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the continuing negotiations.The United States currently has a range of confidential agreements with countries governing how much information each will share about its citizens traveling on commercial airliners. Many countries share only information about passengers traveling to the United States while others including several in the Caribbean have agreed to share more information about other countries that their residents visit.In the case of Pakistan American officials are seeking details like the recent travel histories of airline passengers and how they paid for their tickets.President Obama has given his top aides a deadline of the next few weeks to resolve the issues with Pakistan the officials said. That pressure to deliver results has prompted senior officials like Gen. James L. Jones the national security adviser and Leon E. Panetta the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to warn senior Pakistani leaders of the risks to the countrys relationship with the United States if a deadly terrorist attack originated in their country.
Some American aides have told Pakistani officials that the United States might be forced to increase airstrikes in Pakistan in the event of such an attack though two senior American military officials said there was no special planning under way for such action.Terrorists are enemies of both Pakistan and the United States who need to discuss how to enhance cooperation and that is what we are doing Husain Haqqani Pakistans ambassador to the United States said in a text message on Sunday. Pressuring an ally is not the way forward and both sides understand that.Adm. Mike Mullen chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to comment Sunday on any military planning and said American and Pakistani officials were working closely to hunt Qaeda leaders who are hiding in Pakistans tribal areas.
Were very concerned about that part of the world Admiral Mullen said on Fox News Sunday. Thats where Al Qaeda leadership lives. We know that. And were working with Pakistan and quite frankly with Afghanistan to continue to put pressure on that leadership.In their visit to Islamabad two weeks ago General Jones and Mr. Panetta presented Pakistans president Asif Ali Zardari and other top civilian and military officials with a description of links between the Pakistani Taliban and Faisal Shahzad the Pakistani-American arrested by the American authorities as the main suspect in the Times Square case an administration official said.General Jones and Mr. Panetta thanked the Pakistanis for their cooperation in the investigation but they also prodded their hosts to take tougher steps against the Taliban and other groups and to resolve several issues that Pakistan has delayed.The United States is proposing to open a new consulate in Quetta in southwestern Pakistan where the C.I.A. would most likely have a sizable presence.The White House also wants Pakistan to end a months long dispute over refusing to grant visas to American government workers and contractors in the country.In the wake of the failed Times Square terrorist attack and its direct links to extremist groups based in Pakistan the president instructed General Jones and Director Panetta to go deliver a clear message to Pakistani authorities of the need to step up our counterterrorism cooperation to prevent an attack on the homeland and to address a common terrorist threat Michael A. Hammer a National Security Council spokesman said in an e-mail message on Sunday.The airline passenger issue which General Jones and Mr. Panetta also raised in their meetings is particularly contentious but has remained largely out of public view. We are offering to assist the Pakistanis with their border control challenges including providing them technology and expertise that will allow them to better manage and monitor travel into and out of Pakistan for security purposes said a senior administration official.Analysts at the National Targeting Center in northern Virginia an arm of United States Customs and Border Protection could for example examine the travel patterns of Pakistanis with known links to militant groups who fly to Persian Gulf countries where donors to Al Qaeda and the Taliban live.But it would be explosive with Pakistani public opinion for the government to be seen as cooperating with the United States on the identities of Pakistani passengers. A recent poll by a Western embassy in Islamabad showed that only 4 percent of the respondents had a favorable view of the United States so sharing individual names with the American government would be immensely unpopular.We know this is sensitive for the Pakistan government and were trying to strike the right balance a senior administration official said.The renewed urgency in the negotiations comes against the backdrop of evidence that both Mr. Shahzad and Najibullah Zazi a former airport shuttle bus driver arrested last fall as the main suspect in a failed plot to bomb three New York City subway lines received training in Pakistans tribal areas.The talks also come about two months after Mr. Obama approved a new security protocol for people flying to the United States. The intelligence-based security system was created to raise flags about travelers whose names do not appear on no-fly watch lists but whose travel patterns or personal traits create suspicions. The system is intended to pick up fragments of information  family name nationality age or even partial passport number  and match them against intelligence reports to sound alarms before a passenger boards a plane.

Hello Barbie is displayed at the Mattel showroom at the North American International Toy Fair. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)
At a recent New York toy fair a Mattel representative introduced the newest version of Barbie by saying: ""Welcome to NewYork Barbie."" The doll named Hello Barbie responded: ""I love New York! Don't you? Tell me what's your favorite part about the city? Thefood fashion or the sights?"" To revive the sinking sales of its flagship brand Mattel is bringing Barbie to life with voice-recognition software thatwill allow the doll to ""listen"" to children speak and give chatty responses. It will learn over time remembering your dog'sname and adjusting to new topics. This WiFi-connected Barbie may soon be a hit among children used to tinkering with iPads but children's privacy advocatesare crying foul. Hello Barbie may be more accurately called ""eavesdropping"" Barbie says one advocacy group. Another populardescription? Creepy. Hello Barbie works by recording a child's voice with an embedded microphone that is triggered by pressing a button on thedoll. As the doll ""listens"" audio recordings travel over the Web to a server where the snippets of speech are recognizedand processed. That information is used to help form Hello Barbie's responses. ""If I had a young child I would be very concerned that my child's intimate conversations with her doll were being recordedand analyzed"" Angela Campbell faculty adviser at Georgetown University's Center on Privacy and Technology said in a statement. The concern underscores a tricky challenge facing the toy industry as it struggles to keep up with children's growing affinityfor technology and Web-enabled gadgets. Sales of Barbie have plummeted recently while demand for children's apps and onlinegames has exploded. Children are forging their digital footprint earlier than ever forcing parents to make thorny decisionsabout what kinds of technology limits to put in place during playtime. Mattel and ToyTalk the San Francisco-based start-up that created the technology used in the doll say the privacy and securityof the technology have been their top priority. ""Mattel is committed to safety and security and Hello Barbie conforms toapplicable government standards"" Mattel said in a statement. The doll is expected to hit store shelves in the fall and ToyTalk says it is still developing its privacy policy. But beforethe technology is activated parents probably will have to sign into an app create an account and consent to their children'svoices being recorded ToyTalk says. In an interview ToyTalk chief executive Oren Jacob stressed that the audio files the doll collects will be used only to improvethe product including helping it build better speech recognition models for children. ""The data is never used for anythingto do with marketing or publicity or any of that stuff. Not at all"" Jacob said. But the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood launched a petition Wednesday calling on Mattel to scrap the doll. The technologycould leave children vulnerable to stealth advertising the group says. Children could for example be subtly encouragedto ask their parents for related Barbie toys or accessories they say. ""Kids using 'Hello Barbie' aren't only talking to a doll they are talking directly to a toy conglomerate whose only interestin them is financial"" Susan Linn the group's director said in a statement. ""It's creepy - and creates a host of dangersfor children and families."" The criticism of Hello Barbie comes at a difficult time for Mattel. Bryan Stockton resigned as the toymaker's chief executivein January after a string of poor earnings results. In the fourth quarter Mattel's profit tumbled 59 percent. Sales of Barbiesank 21 percent and sales of its baby-oriented Fisher-Price brand declined 16 percent. Mattel says Hello Barbie will offer children a highly engaging play experience in part because the doll will learn aboutits users over time. At the demonstration at the New York toy fair the Mattel representative chatting with Hello Barbiementioned that she liked being onstage. Later in the conversation when the Mattel representative asked Hello Barbie whatshe should be when she grew up the doll responded ""Well you told me you like being onstage. So maybe a dancer? Or a politician?Or how about a dancing politician?"" Parents can choose to receive daily or weekly e-mails with access to the audio files of their children's conversations withHello Barbie. ""We want to make sure parents are in control of their family's data at all times"" said Jacob ToyTalk's chiefexecutive. But even that extra layer of transparency is ""troubling"" Linn said. ""Children confide in their dolls"" she said. ""When children have conversations with dolls and stuffed animals they're playingand they reveal a lot about themselves.""
Do you think Mattel should halt production on Hello Barbie?

Google Responds to Google+ Account Suspension Controversy
Using Google+? Add Mashable to your circles. You'll get the latest about new Google+ features and tips and tricks for using the platform as well as top social media and technology news.
Google has finally made a public statement about the recent wave of controversial Google+ account suspensions designed to enforce the company's ""common name"" policy.
The policy is outlined in section 13 of the company's User Content and Conduct Policy. It's designed to stop users from creating fake profiles and to set a positive tone. Section 13 reads as follows:
""To help fight spam and prevent fake profiles use the name your friends family or co-workers usually call you. For example if your full legal name is Charles Jones Jr. but you normally use Chuck Jones or Junior Jones either of those would be acceptable.""
This weekend Google started enforcing the policy deleting a large number of Google+ accounts. While some of the suspended accounts were indeed fake profiles others like Limor ""Ladyada"" Fried and lifestyle blogger A.V. Flox were accidentally deleted and quickly restored.
SEE ALSO: GOOGLE+: THE COMPLETE GUIDE | VIDEOS | REVIEW
Google SVP of Social Vic Gundotra admitted to Robert Scoble on Sunday that the company has made some mistakes with its first attempt at cracking down on fake profiles. And Monday Google VP of Product Bradley Horowitz wrote a more detailed post in an attempt to clear the air and set the record straight.
""Weve noticed that many violations of the Google+ common name policy were in fact well-intentioned and inadvertent and for these users our process can be frustrating and disappointing"" Horowitz said in his Google+ post. ""So were currently making a number of improvements to this process specifically regarding how we notify these users that theyre not in compliance with Google+ policies and how we communicate the remedies available to them.""
- Google will give users more warning and the chance to comply with the common name policy.- The company is improving the signup process.- Finally the search giant is exploring better ways to support nicknames maiden names and pseudonyms.
Horowitz also took time to dispel the rumor that a suspension of a Google+ account means that a user loses his or her access to Gmail Google Docs or other Google services. ""When an account is suspended for violating the Google+ common name standards access to Gmail or other products that dont require a Google+ profile are not removed"" he said.
Google+ which will hit its one-month anniversary on Thursday has clearly been suffering from growing pains. It has received strong criticism for its handling of Google+ brand pages.

Southern Phone Company breaches customer privacy ACMA finds
Details of 3854 customers published in three online directories by mistake
Hamish Barwick (Computerworld) on 26 June 2015 13:22
Southern Phone Company (SPC) failed to protect the privacy of 3854 silent line customers when uploading customer data to the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND) the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has ruled.Phone numbers names and address details were published in three online directories between 18 March and 24 July last year.In addition some of the customer had their details published in paper directories. SPC notified all customers about the privacy breach and offered them a new phone number free of charge.ACMA found that SPC contravened clause 4.6.3 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code clause 5.12 of the IPND industry code and subsection 101 (1) of the Telecommunications Act 1997.Failure by a telco provider to honour a customers request for a silent number is an issue that the ACMA takes very seriously particularly given that such requests often arise from concerns over personal safety said ACMA chairperson Chris Chapman.
SPC's enforceable undertaking commits it to upgrading its data collection engaging an independent auditor to review its processes beginning an education and training program and reporting to the ACMA.If SPC does not meet the enforceable undertaking it would be subject to Federal Court proceedings said Chapman.SPC has been approached for comment.Follow Hamish Barwick on Twitter: @HamishBarwick

Privacy Commissioner investigating iiNet data breach
Breach allegedly occurred after hacker compromised a database
Hamish Barwick (Computerworld) on 26 June 2015 14:54
Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim has opened an investigation into an alleged data breach involving iiNet subsidiary Westnet.The data breach allegedly occurred earlier this monthafter a hacker compromised a database containing the personal information of some Westnet customers and offered the information for sale online.iiNet is cooperating with the OAICs enquiries. The OAIC will publish a further statement at the conclusion of its investigation an OAIC statement said.At the time iiNet CIO Matthew Toohey said that the company was investigating the matter and that the incident had been reported to law enforcement agencies.iiNet is aware of an incident that may have resulted in unauthorised access to old customer information stored on a legacy Westnet system. Customer username address telephone and in some cases password information may have been accessed however no payment details were stored on the server. The system is now offline and at no further risk he said.
iiNet has been contacted for comment.Follow Hamish Barwick on Twitter: @HamishBarwickFollow Computerworld Australia on Twitter: @ComputerworldAU or take part in the Computerworld conversation on LinkedIn: Computerworld Australia

pri_250_db,dorm mates of tyler clementi secretly video record.txt,"Suicide of Tyler Clementi - Wikipedia the free encyclopedia
George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee New Jersey U.S.
Tyler Clementi (December 19 1991  September 22 2010) was an 18-year-old American student at Rutgers University in Piscataway New Jersey who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge on September 22 2010. On September 19 2010 Clementi's roommate Dharun Ravi used a webcam on his dorm-room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view without Clementi's knowledge Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend though the viewing never occurred.
Ravi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. Ravi was tried and convicted in 2012 on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. Clementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.
Clementi was born on December 19 1991[2] in Ridgewood New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.[3]
A few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers Clementi told his parents that he was gay.[4] While his father supported him Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had ""basically completely rejected"" him.[4][5] In later interviews Clementi's mother explained that she had been ""sad"" and ""quiet"" as she processed the information and that she ""felt a little betrayed"" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation she said that she and Tyler cried hugged and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother Tyler seemed ""confident"" and ""comfortable"" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.[5][6][7]
Ravi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North.[8] Prior to arriving at Rutgers Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on the Just Us Boys website and tweeted ""Found out my roommate is gay."" Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page.[4][6] After Ravi and Clementi moved in together they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.[6]

On the nights of September 19 and 21 Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion Ravi met Clementi's male friend and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns.[6][9] Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay.[10] Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room though Ravi was not there.[11] During this second viewing Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.[12]
On September 20 Clementi who followed Ravi's Twitter account read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: ""Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.""[6][12] According to a Rutgers employee at about 4 a.m. on September 21 Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his ""roommate used webcam to spy on me.""[13]
On September 21 Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest along with directions on how to view it remotely.[14] At 6:39p.m. Ravi tweeted ""Anyone with iChat I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes it's happening again.""[6] Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed.[6] When Clementi returned to his room he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.[11][12]
The same day Clementi complained to a resident assistant[15] and two other officials[16] that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m.[17][18] and in his official report of the meeting the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi.[19] In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting Clementi described the two viewing incidents quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings and wrote ""I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.""[6] Clementi wrote in detail on the Just Us Boys[20] and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. ""He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously"" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.[21][12]
Within a few hours Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.[6][12]
Tyler Clementi jumped from the George Washington Bridge and was found dead in the Hudson River.
On the evening of September 22 Clementi left the dorm room bought food from the campus food court and around 6:30p.m. headed toward the George Washington Bridge.[6] By 8:42p.m. Clementi had made his way to the George Washington Bridge and posted from his cell phone on Facebook ""Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.""[6][12]
Clementi left a suicide note which along with documents on his computer was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.[12][22]
Clementi's wallet was found on September 22 on the walkway adjacent to the bridge's eastbound lanes after witnesses reported seeing someone on the bridge. His car cell phone and computer were also found near the bridge. Police recovered a body on September 29 in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. It was confirmed the next day that the body recovered was Clementi.[3][12]
The medical examiner's autopsy report cites drowning as the cause of death and notes blunt impact injuries to his torso.[23][12]
Shortly after Clementi's suicide the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated ""There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey Texas California Indiana and Minnesota.""[24] The same month Clementi died four other American teenagers were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality[25] although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.[26]
Rutgers University students planned a ""Black Friday"" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated ""We grieve for him and for his family friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....""[27][28]
Beginning in the 20112012 school year a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.[29][30]
By fall 2012 Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students in reaction to the suicide including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.[31]
Tyler Clementi's parents Jane and Joseph Clementi established the Tyler Clementi Foundation which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.[32]
On March 9 2011 the Point Foundation the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory.[33] Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would ""raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.""[34]
Tyler Clementi's suicide along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed moved President Barack Obama Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying.[35] US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act"" to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.[36][37] Harvey Silverglate working with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education has criticized that bill and similar legislation for what he considers to be the creation of rights that apply to some groups of persons but not to others.[37]
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an ""unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night"" and added ""as the father of a 17-year-old I can't imagine what those parents are feeling todayI can't.""[38] In response to Clementi's suicide and other similar incidents New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan ""Anti-bullying Bill of Rights"" in November 2010 which passed on a 711 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 300 vote in the New Jersey Senate.[39]
The San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian gay bisexual transgender and questioning students.[40]
The day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial Clementi's father Joseph released a statement directed particularly at young people:
""You're going to meet a lot of people in your lifetime. Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong tell them: ""That's not right. Stop it."" The change you want to see in the world begins with you.""[41]
In the same statement Jane Clementi Tyler's mother noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:
""In this digital world we need to teach our youngsters that their actions have consequences that their words have real power to hurt or to help. They must be encouraged to choose to build people up and not tear them down.""[42]
In the weeks following Clementi's suicide schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil[43] and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County near Ridgewood where Clementi lived wore all black to mourn his death.[44]
The incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth.[45] A commemoration called ""Spirit Day"" first observed on October 20 2010 was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth.[46] Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day[47] and the day received widespread support from GLAAD Hollywood celebrities[48] and over 1.6 million Facebook users.[49][50] The Human Rights Campaign a gay-rights advocacy organization released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S.[51] According to gay activist William Dobbs around 10000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges such as manslaughter against Ravi and Wei a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.[52]
However journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that ""there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.""[53] William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei.[54] Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are ""pervasive in our culture"".[55] Dan Savage co-founder of the It Gets Better Project has written that although he considers Ravi's actions to have been ""the last straw"" that triggered Clementi's suicide he notes that Clementi's guest did not commit suicide and concludes that there must have been additional factors preceding the webcam incidents contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the ""mob mentality"" that focuses on ""a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't."" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the ""adults and institutions"" in society who ""perpetuate anti-gay prejudice"" and he concludes that to ""pin all the blame"" on Ravi and Wei amounts to ""a coverup"".[56] After Ravi was sentenced Savage said he had been ""express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far far too lenienta slap on the wrist.""[57] Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that ""At best we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.""[58]
The Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying was launched in October 2015.[59]
Soon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants.[60] After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News a ""media floodgate of distortion"" ensued.[60] Writing in The New Yorker Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident writing that after Clementi's suicide ""it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact there was no posting no observed sex and no closet.""[6]
Ellen DeGeneres described herself as ""devastated"" by Clementi's death stating ""Something must be done. This month alone there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country and the death rate is climbing.""[61]
The band Rise Against released a song Make It Stop (September's Children) which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other people who committed suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.[62]
Madonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called ""The Secret Seven"" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.
Monica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.[63]
On September 28 2010 Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt.[64] On April 20 2011 a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy bias intimidation tampering with evidence witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution.[65]
On May 6 2011 Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi 300 hours of community service counseling and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.[66][67]
On March 16 2012 Ravi was tried and convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents.[68] On May 21 2012 Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail 3 years' probation 300 hours of community service a $10000 fine and counseling on cyberbullying and alternate lifestyles.[69] Both the prosecutors[70] and Ravi[71] have filed separate appeals. It is expected to be at least mid-2014 before any appeal will be heard.[72] On June 18 2012 Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence.[73] Federal immigration authorities have said that Ravi will not be deported to India.[74]

pri_250_db,google doodle contest asks for last 4 digits of ss.txt,"Why Has Google Been Collecting Kids' Social Security Numbers Under the Guise of an Art Contest?
Why Has Google Been Collecting Kids' Social Security Numbers Under the Guise of an Art Contest?
Director of 'The Cartel' a documentary about corruption in American public education and Executive Director of ChoiceMedia.TV an education reform news service
As the director of The Cartel documentary one of the things I learned was how poorly the traditional news media cover issues pertaining to children in that case corruption in public education.
Since the film's release I often get contacted about other aspects of child protection that I would have never imagined -- stories that don't seem to get attention elsewhere. Like this.
What you're about to read hasn't been reported anywhere and when it was brought to my attention I could hardly believe it.
It turns out that the company sporting the motto ""don't be evil"" has been asking parents nationwide to disclose their children's personal information including Social Security Numbers and recruiting schools to help them do it -- all under the guise of an art contest.
It's called ""Doodle-4-Google"" a rather catchy kid-friendly name if I do say so myself. The company is even offering prize money to schools to enlist their help with the promotion. Doesn't it sound like fun? Don't you want your kid to enter too?
What could be wrong with filling out a few entry forms?
A national commercial database of names and addresses of American children especially one that includes their dates of birth and SSNs would be worth many millions to marketing firms and retailers.
Of course data collection is not the reason Google gives for doing this competition. Their FAQ says it's because ""We love to encourage and celebrate the creativity of young people..."" etc. If that's so then why on earth would the contest's original Parent Consent Form ask for the child's city of birth date of birth and last four digits of the child's SSN? Along with complete contact info of the parents.
You see what Google knows and many parents don't know is that a person's city of birth and year of birth can be used to make a statistical guess about the first five digits of his/her social security number. Then if you can somehow obtain those last four SSN digits explicitly -- voila you've unlocked countless troves of personal information from people who didn't even understand that such a disclosure was happening.
This kind of data can be linked with other databases to target advertising. It's worth many times more than what Google will spend on prizes (each State Finalist gets a T-shirt!).
In fairness we have no evidence that Google will use or sell this information for marketing purposes. For that matter it's possible they could throw the data away.(Care to guess the odds?) But to be absolutely clear there's no evidence Google has done anything with this information at all nefarious or otherwise.
It's also clear that children's social security numbers shouldn't be required for an art contest.
There's a second chapter to this story.Some of the people who tipped me off to it were wondering if the solicitation of children's Social Security Numbers was even legal.And so they sent emails to the Federal Trade Commission the website InsideGoogle.com and a couple of other places. That email went out on February 17. Twenty-six hours later Google released an updated Parental Consent form without requiring the last four digits of the child's SSN although the form still inexplicably asks for the child's city of birth.
Meanwhile the original PDF can still be found on lots of school websites like this one. In other words many schools are still distributing the original form and many parents are no doubt still forking over their kids' social security numbers to Google.
At least the contest ""privacy notice"" is clear enough: ""participation constitutes consent to the storage use and disclosure of the Entrant's entry details...."" It should really be called the ""privacy waiver.""
I sent all of this to Google's press office and after 48 hours they had offered no response.
So in closing three simple ideas for you gentle reader to take away. (1) City of birth when coupled with year of birth can be correlated to social security numbers so don't give it out just because a box appears on a form. (2) No public contest should ask for any part of a social security number especially involving kids. (3) For internet searches have you tried Yahoo! or Bing lately?
(They're probably both improved since you last tried them.)
Google's Spokesperson just contacted me with the following response:
This year we started accepting doodles from kids even if their school hadn't registered for the contest. To help us keep entries distinct and remove duplicate entries from any particular student we asked parents for limited information including the last 4 digits of a student's social security number. We later updated our forms when we recognized that we could sufficiently separate legitimate contest entries while requesting less information. To be clear these last 4 digits were not entered into our records and will be safely discarded.
The city of birth helps us identify whether contestants are eligible for the contest as winners must be either U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents of the U.S. The information isn't used for any other purpose.
1.) I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist by disposition but doesn't ""these last 4 digits were not entered into our records and will be safely discarded"" sound like a contradiction?
(How can they delete something that is not in their records?)
Even taking just the first part we're supposed to believe Google didn't enter
Isn't this the same Google that promotes itself as the master of targeted marketing campaigns?
2.) If they simply want to limit the contest to citizens and permanent legal residents why not ask that question as a ""yes/no""?
Then they could ask more specific questions of the winners right?
Instead Google's wants every child's city of birth upfront?
A follow-up clarification came from a Google spokesperson:
To be clear all data concerning students that is collected by Doodle 4 Google is used only to administer the contest. We received this information on paper because parents who downloaded the original Parent Consent form had to print it fill it out and mail it to us. The last 4 digits of the social security number were not entered into our contest records and as indicated any forms containing this information will be safely discarded.
We have asked for city of birth all 4 years of the contest to date as it helps us determine eligibility. For example if the city is not in the U.S. we can flag it for possible future follow-up. The question also gives us a higher degree of confidence at this early stage that an actual parent or guardian is completing the form (it's easier to check 'Yes' than to know an actual city of birth). As indicated previously this information is not used for any other purpose.

F.B.I. Violated Rules in Obtaining Phone Records Report Says
WASHINGTON  The Federal Bureau of Investigation improperly obtained calling records for more than 3500 telephone accounts from 2003 to 2006 without following any legal procedures according to a newly disclosed report by the Justice Departments inspector general.Instead according to the 289-page report F.B.I. agents informally requested the records from employees of three unidentified telephone companies who were stationed inside a bureau communications office.Based on nothing more than e-mail messages or scribbled requests on Post-it notes the phone employees turned over customer calling records the report said.On some occasions the phone employees allowed the F.B.I. to upload call records to government databases. On others they allowed agents to view records on their computer screens a practice that became known as sneak peeks.Moreover the report found that the F.B.I. improperly uploaded into its databases large numbers of calling records without determining whether they were relevant to an investigation.On four occasions the bureau made inaccurate statements to a court that authorizes national security wiretaps about how it had obtained calling records the report said.And agents twice improperly gained access to reporters calling records as part of leak investigations.The report was the third by the office of the inspector general Glenn A. Fine to examine problems with how the bureau collected calling records after the 2001 terrorist attacks.The two prior reports in 2007 and 2008 covered problems with the use of administrative subpoenas called national security letters and exigent letters  emergency records requests that were supposed to be followed up by formal subpoenas.The use of exigent letters became casual the inspector found with agents issuing them when there was no real emergency.The new report adds details to that account while disclosing the 3500 additional instances in which F.B.I. agents got records without even exigent letters.In a statement released Wednesday the F.B.I. said
that it had acknowledged repeatedly that it did not have in place adequate internal controls to ensure that appropriate process was used and that appropriate records were kept.The F.B.I. has dropped its use of exigent letters and instituted a stronger set of
record-keeping requirements. It has also stopped having phone company employees working in the same place as F.B.I. agents the report said.

Previous: How the Tumblr worm spread soquicklyNext: Sophos Security Threat Report 2013  the safest and riskiest countriesrevealed
Do you understand the dangers of having geo-tagging enabled in photographs you take on your iPhone?
The latest development in the ongoing media circus around John McAfee has highlighted the issue once more.
Like many others Ive been following the bizarre story of John McAfee who has been on the run from the Belize police since mid-November.
John McAfee of course founded the anti-virus company McAfee.
And the authorities in Belize have named John McAfee as a person of interest after one of his neighbours was found shot dead.
Now its important to underline that John McAfee a pioneer in the anti-virus industry has had nothing to do with the business since the 1990s.
One thing John McAfee remains however is a character.
He appears to have recently taken delight in keeping the world informed by blogging about his escapades conducting media interviews and even describing how he has disguised himself as a Guatemalan trinket peddler to evade capture.
This has no doubt frustrated the crime authorities in Belize but all along I have wondered if John McAfees taunting of those who are hoping to question him might be his undoing.
Twitter user @simplenomad noticed that a picture published today by Vice Magazine contained some information that John McAfee might have preferred remained secret.
Check the metadata in the photo. Oooops. http://t.co/pZOcGWm3
Sure enough the image of John McAfee with Vices editor-in-chief Rocco Castoro contains EXIF data that reveals amongst other things the GPS latitude and longitude co-ordinates of where it was taken.
Presumably whoever took the photo on their iPhone 4S had forgotten to turn off location services.
Those co-ordinates suggest that John McAfee was photographed in Guatemala having crossed the Belize border.
Of course John McAfee is a person of interest in a police investigation and has not been officially accused of any crime.
But it would be ironic indeed if John McAfee a man who was a leading light in the anti-virus industry 20-25 years ago was located by the authorities because of sloppy IT security.
The lesson that all of us should learn is to be very careful about what information a photograph might be secretly carrying within it regarding the when and where a picture was taken.
This wasnt an easy article to write as it involves someone who  although I never met him  I feel was an important element in the early years of my career in computer security.
Just as I was about to post this article I saw that in his latest blog post John McAfee claims he faked the EXIF data in the photograph to create a fake emergency.
But in the strange ongoing story of John McAfee its becoming increasingly hard to know what to believe.

And here I thought the lesson was don't murder your neighbor and go on the run from the police while taunting them through the use of remote communications technologies thereby sparking an international manhunt.
It is now July 9 2i013. So where in the world is John McAfee and why is he not in custody? Did he buy his freedom or what. Is escape and capture that difficult in the computer age?
Very easy to modify EXIF data. Plenty of tools available
By first teaching yourself a bit of culture to learn that ""Guatemalen"" isn't even a word and that the official language is Spanish.
Here check this entry on the barely known encyclopedia called Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala
Ignoring the fact that he didn't photograph himself and didn't upload the photo..
As Graham says its best to treat John McAfee as innocent until proven guilty but even assuming he didnt have anything directly to do with the death of his neighbour his escapades suggest either theres something hes trying to hide from the Belize police or he thinks they wont treat him fairly. Only time will tell  no doubt well find out more (eventually)
Maybe the Belize police should track sales of Just-for-Men instead
It looks like a cardboard cut-out of the guy anyway.
Notice how much clearer the other fellow in the photo is
Maybe John McAfee is really the most interesting man in the world.
""Vice Magazine reporters are indeed with me in Guatemala.
Yesterday was chaotic due to the accidental release of my exact co-ordinates by an unseasoned technician at Vice headquarters.
I had to cancel numerous interviews with the press yesterday because of this and I apologize to all of those affected.""
I'd alter the location myself to throw the dogs off the trail. Good move to make it over the border in Guatemala. It vastly expands the scope of the hunt and forces authorities to send no doubt thin resources to the border. (you'd know where they are)
And who knows he could be on the other side of the country or even in a different country altogether like Mexico.
That is if A) you believe a word JM says and B) he is actually intelligent. My jury is still out on both scores.
Even if he did drop the ball it's still smart to say he faked the data it injects a LOT of uncertainty. Is he lying? Is he actually where the EXIF says he is but says he faked it because he knew authorities would assume he's lying??
He does make it fun. Much better than Farewell Trelaine chasing Captain Kirk around a cheap set.
Ever condider that the EXIF info was spoofed.. Standard MO for a person who uses disguises.
Looks fake. Was he writing and smoking at the same time with the same hand? Also easy to fake gps details. Probably he is in Texas.
Either real or fake neither would surprise me in this case.

Privacy Groups Fault Online Health Sites for Sharing User Data With Marketers
with more than 20 million registered users that offers online medical information and e-mail newsletters on a variety of topics including diabetes allergies asthma and arthritis.
But according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Trade Commission site visitors who provide personal details about themselves might not be aware that QualityHealth collects information about peoples medical conditions preferred medicines and treatment plans and uses it to profile its users for prescription drug marketing.Rob Rebak
the chief executive of QualityHealth a company also known as Marketing Technology Solutions of Delaware did not return a request for comment.QualityHealth is one of a number of companies cited in the complaint to the F.T.C. filed by four nonprofit privacy and consumer advocacy groups. In the complaint the Center for Digital Democracy U.S. PIRG
charged that online marketing of medications products and medical services posed fundamental new risks to consumer privacy and health because of sophisticated
QualityHealth.com is one of the Web sites listed in a complaint filed by privacy groups to the Federal Trade Commission.
Asserting that such techniques are unfair and deceptive the groups asked the F.T.C. to investigate the health marketing used by some popular sites including Google HealthCentral Everyday Health WebMD and Sermo a site for medical professionals.Some sites the complaint said were not transparent enough about how they tracked people through users online heath searches and discussions or how they categorized and marketed to their conditions.
open about how they create and use data profiles about users or
and sponsored content the complaint said.The concern said Ed Mierzwinski the consumer program director at U.S. PIRG is not just about data mining and marketing that could influence patients to seek drugs they do not need or to spend more money on branded drugs rather than generics. More broadly employers or health insurers could gain access to the consumers data profiles leading to potential problems or penalties against the consumer he said.You could be searching for health information about your cat or your neighbor and it could end up harming your health care in terms of denial or increased cost Mr. Mierzwinski said. If people knew what kind of surveillance eavesdropping and data mining were being used to collect information about you encourage your use of prescription drugs and essentially use you as a research guinea pig I think people would think twice.The complaint comes at a delicate moment for online and social media marketing of medical products and services. The Food and Drug Administration which oversees drug marketing is developing industry guidelines for digital and social media. In a two-day agency hearing on the subject last winter many health sites drug makers and marketing firms promoted the idea of digital health as a tool that empowered consumers allowing patients to easily access medical information and form supportive interactive communities with other patients.
There are clear public health benefits for health care providers and patients to be able to access truthful scientifically accurate and F.D.A.-regulated information about medicines online from the companies that research and develop them said Jeffrey K. Francer
assistant general counsel of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
an industry trade group. His group is still reviewing the complaint he said.But Jeff Chester
the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy said that the industry had provided the F.D.A with a fairy-tale version of digital health marketing.Online data collection techniques give pharmaceutical companies and health marketers a kind of digital X-ray of a health consumers concerns fears and behaviors Mr. Chester said. There is no meaningful disclosure of how that data is collected and used.A notice at the bottom of QualityHealths member registration form for example provides a link to the sites privacy policy. The policy explains that information that may or may not identify someone may be used for ads aimed at consumers.But QualityHealth provides greater detail about its methods in its pitch to business clients  like how the site uses tailored messages informed by patient profiling to prompt members to seek prescriptions for specific brands from their doctors.We can reach consumers just before their next doctor visit the site says as well as follow up with reminders and relevant information for maximum impact.The sites privacy policy states that the company is committed to providing consumers with clear notice and choice about its practices and that visitors are asked to opt in to the companys data use policy.Adam Grossberg
a spokesman for WebMD said that WebMD had always been transparent and direct with its users. All sponsored content on our site is clearly labeled as such he said. He added that the company could not comment on the specifics of the complaint because it had not received it.A spokesman for Google said the company declined to comment for this article. HealthCentral Everyday Health and Sermo did not respond to requests for comment.The groups decided to file their complaint with the F.T.C. Mr. Chester said because it oversees consumer privacy issues and because the groups believed that the F.D.A. which has long overseen traditional marketing of drugs in print radio and television lacked the staff and the expertise to oversee online and social media drug marketing. An F.D.A. spokeswoman said the agency planned to review the complaint.David Vladeck
the director of the F.T.C.s bureau on consumer protection said he had not yet read the complaint. But he said the F.T.C. plans to soon release a report about online privacy because it is concerned about sensitive personal information.Mr. Vladeck
a core privacy question. Suppose someone goes online to read about depression should that person get targeted with ads for antidepressants for counseling services or books about depression?

pri_250_db,avg changes privacy policy to allow more data shar.txt,"Is AVG planning to sell user data to advertisers following privacy policy change? - 17 Sep 2015
Is AVG planning to sell user data to advertisers following privacy policy change?
Czech Republic-based security software vendor AVG producer of one of the world's most popular anti-virus software suites has come under fire over it's privacy policy which appears to allow it to sell users' data to advertisers.
The company though in a blog posting and an email to Computing denies that it is planning to sell ""personally identifiable data"" to anyone.
EU agrees data protection regulation  despite cloud computing warnings from Amazon Cisco IBM and SAP
Microsoft warns of 'global free for all' that will destroy personal privacy
Privacy concerns prevent Facebook from releasing 'Moments' face-recognition technology in Europe
New UN privacy chief calls for Geneva Convention on internet privacy
The new policy which AVG's website says will come into effect in October 2015 has apparently been changed to explicitly allow the collection and sale of personal information relating to browsing history searches location and meta-data. Previous policies indicated that the firm only collected browsing data when a person used their their web site as well as information about any malware on the user's machine.
The site does not offer a list of changes made to the policy other than to provide a link to PDFs of previous versions.
Under the heading ""What do you collect that cannot identify me"" AVG's new policy states:
""We collect non-personal data to make money from our free offerings so we can keep them free including: Advertising ID associated with your devices Browsing and search history including meta data; Internet service provider or mobile network you use to connect to our products; and Information regarding other applications you may have on your device and how they are used.
""Sometimes browsing history or search history contains terms that might identify you. If we become aware that part of your browsing history might identify you we will treat that portion of your history as personal data and will anonymize this information. We may also aggregate and/or anonymize personal data we collect about you.
""For instance although we would consider your precise location to be personal data if stored separately if we combined the locations of our users into a data set that could only tell us how many users were located in a particular country we would not consider this aggregated information to be personally identifiable.""
The company says it will share ""certain personal data"" with affiliated partners search providers and resellers. If as the latest privacy policy seems to indicate AVG has altered its terms to allow its anti-virus or other software to harvest user data from the machine on which it is installed this has serious implications says privacy campaigner Alexander Hanff.
""Anti-virus software runs on our devices with elevated privileges so it can detect and block malware and other threats"" he says. ""It is wholly unacceptable for an anti-virus software vendor to abuse those privileges to build detailed browsing location and search profiles. It places AVG squarely into the category of spyware - which is what they are supposed to stop not what they are supposed to be.""
Hanff goes on to say that the terms of the policy may also put AVG in contravention of forthcoming EU data-protection legislation.
""AVG's definition of identifiable data does not match the official opinion of the Article 29 Working Party which states that any data that can be used to single out an individual (such as a user ID IP address or device fingerprint) is classed as identifiable information"" he told Computing.
""Secondly under Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive any company that collects data about individuals by accessing files on their device must obtain the informed consent of that individual.
It is unlikely that a change to a privacy policy to which many users may never be exposed if they are already using the product would meet the necessary notice and consent requirements of many jurisdictions in the EU and it would certainly seem to be incompatible with the upcoming GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] soon to be finalised in Europe.""
Hanff goes on to mention possible antitrust issues given that AVG actively blocks other companies who collect data to profile users' behaviour for the purpose of selling it to advertisers. This could potentially be used to give the company a competitive advantage he argues urging users to uninstall the product.
Computing has asked AVG to clarify its new privacy policy and the changes it represents. We will publish its response when we receive it.
In response to our request AVG sent a link to a new blog post which seeks to clarify the company's intentions. It says:
""We do not and will not sell personally identifiable data to anyone including advertisers. AVG has continually challenged the industry to simplify its privacy policies and provide an informative one-page view. We are proud of our new privacy policy and intend to continue our drive for more transparency and greater user choice.""
Stating that its intention has been to clarify its privacy policy to make it easier to understand AVG says:
""When creating our new policy format we decided that our customers should have the ability to choose whether or not to participate in our anonymized data collection program. We are currently adding this option to some of our FREE consumer products and we can confirm that no sharing of data will happen until our customers are able to make this choice.""
Computing has asked for further clarification as to which products (free or paid for) are affected and what constitutes personally identifiable data in the light of Hanff's comments above.
1) We have been very clear that we do not and will not sell personally identifiable data to anyone. We welcome the attention our privacy policy is receiving as it highlights the industry need for simpler privacy policies. We are delivering on our promises of simplifying our privacy policy and in continuing to give our customers clear choice.
2) Our customers have already seen great benefit from reports we've generated such as the AVG App Report which identifies the top battery data and storage consuming apps. This data has been well received by our customers and well publicized by the media who find such information extremely valuable for managing their mobile devices.

pri_250_db,hundreds of ios apps found to be collecting pii us.txt,"Weve found hundreds of apps in the App Store that extract personally identifiable user information via private APIs that Apple has forbidden them from calling. This is the first time weve seen iOS apps successfully bypass the app review process. But based on what we learned it might not be the last.
We found these apps while adding support to Searchlight to scan for private API usage. This is something that will get your app rejected by app review so we want to alert our users to this problem before it costs them time especially when theyre trying to get a critical update out.
iOS binaries contain ARM machine code that our system disassembles. When you make a call to an Objective-C method it is vectored through objc_msgSend which receives the class and method names as strings. In nearly all cases these strings can be statically resolved in the disassembly by looking at data references prior to the call to objc_msgSend. We already track the origin and destination class/method of these calls to build a callgraph for each app in order to find which methods are in use.
However in some cases these parameters cant be statically resolved. Since theyre just strings they can be created at runtime by any string manipulation routines. Some tools take advantage of this capability to obfuscate the names of classes and methods descrambling the strings right before calling objc_msgSend.
An app can also call dlopen to load a new library and then dlsym to get access to a function or data member in it. This causes the dynamic linker to map in the named file (first checking its code signature) and then look up the address to the given symbol. The library and symbol names are both strings and thus can also be created at runtime.
SourceDNA disassembles and indexes the behavior of code in millions of apps. To determine if runtime library loading was being used to access private APIs we searched our collection for ones that match this pattern:
Calls dlopen/dlsym or NSClassFromString/NSSelectorFromString
Generates the parameters via one of the various string manipulation functions
This found hundreds of matching calls using sprintf with %s format strings and %@ with NSString stringWithFormat:. We wrote a script to expand these format strings using nearby static strings and then clustered the reconstructed parameters.
We found four main groups of private APIs these apps are calling:
Enumerate the list of installed apps or get the frontmost app name
Enumerate devices and get serial numbers of peripherals
Get a numeric value associated with the users AppleID
Since we also identify SDKs by their binary signatures we noticed that these functions were all part of a common codebase the Youmi advertising SDK from China.
We then associated the clusters of this SDKs code with the release dates of the apps that contain them to see how it has evolved over time. The older versions do not call private APIs so the 142 apps that have them are ok. But almost two years ago we believe the Youmi developers began experimenting with obfuscating a call to get the frontmost app name.
Once they were able to get this through App Review they probably became more confident they werent being detected and added the above behaviors in order. They also use the same obfuscation to hide calls to retrieve the advertising ID which is allowable for tracking ad clicks but they may be using it for other purposes since they went to the trouble to obfuscate this. The latest version of the Youmi SDK (v5.3.0) published a month ago still gathers all the above information.
Apple has been locking down private APIs including blocking apps from reading the platform serial number in iOS 8. Youmi worked around this by enumerating peripheral devices such as the battery system and sending those serial numbers as a hardware identifier.
your developer accounts from a list and we'll tell you what we found about
your apps. We'll also show the commercial and open-source code you're using
We found 256 apps (est. total of 1 million downloads) that have one of the versions of Youmi that violates user privacy. Most of the developers are located in China. We believe the developers of these apps arent aware of this since the SDK is delivered in binary form obfuscated and user info is uploaded to Youmis server not the apps. We recommend developers stop using this SDK until this code is removed.
Another research report was published last week titled iRiS: Vetting Private API Abuse in iOS Applications. The authors built an excellent system that selectively applies dynamic analysis to static call sites that cant be resolved. Credit where credit is due  they found these same patterns in apps before us and correctly attributed it to the Youmi SDK albeit using a different approach and apps.
Given how simple this obfuscation is and how long the apps have been available that have it were concerned other published apps may be using different but related approaches to hide their malicious behavior. Were continuing to add new features to our engine to discover anomalous behavior in app code and find out if this is the case.
We notified our Searchlight customers about this problem to help them address it and then sent a list of affected apps to Apple. Developers need to be aware that when they install an SDK in their app theyre responsible for how it affects their users. This is difficult for binary code (especially if its obfuscated) so well keep providing transparency to help them make informed decisions about the code they use.
Weve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK developed by Youmi a mobile advertising provider that uses private APIs to gather private information such as user email addresses and device identifiers and route data to its company server. This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmis SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected. We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly.
Update (2015/10/24): List of apps and Youmis statement
We released the list of the apps that had the version of the Youmi SDK that accessed private frameworks. Its in CSV format showing the apps store ID name and version. We ask that you cite SourceDNA as the source if you use it in a product such as MDM.
Youmi contacted us with the following response (edited for length):
1) Youmi is NOT collecting any user Apple ID via SDK
appleIDClientIdentifier is a random number but not Apple ID email addresses as your mentioned in the report.
2) Youmi DOES includes private APIs to SDK but our purpose is to avoid frauds activities and getting quality traffic;
3) At this point Youmi released a new SDK; we are communicating with Apple now before any of conclusions we respect Apple Developer Rules and will NOT including any private APIs in our SDK.
SourceDNA verified that the return value of appleIDClientIdentifier: is not an email address. However we do not believe it is a random number. It appears to be a numeric value associated with an AppleID on a given device. We have revised this article accordingly.

If Safe Harbor Is Dead In the Water What Does That Mean for You?
UK first: right-to-be-forgotten notice issued against Google Inc.
To embed copy and paste the code into your website or blog:
The UKs Information Commissioners Office (ICO) has published what appears to be its first public enforcement notice based upon the right to be forgotten against Google Inc. The right to be forgotten was introduced by the ECJ last year when it held that data subjects have a right to compel search engines to remove results linking to websites containing their personal information if those results were outdated or irrelevant.
In the current case Google originally agreed with the data subjects initial right-to-be forgotten request namely that its historic criminal conviction was no longer relevant and removed the link. Unfortunately for the data subject the removal drew more attention to the story causing new articles to be written and Google refused to remove the subsequent links on the basis that they were relevant and in the publics interest.
The ICO considered that the links to the subsequent websites were likely to cause the data subject distress and breach their right to privacy and ordered Google to remove the links to websites. David Smith Deputy Commissioner at the ICO said that while the ICO understands that newspapers will want to write about links being removed it is unnecessary for such links to be found by searching the data subjects name. As such Google has 35 days to remove the offending links or risk further enforcement action.
Organisations that receive such enforcement notices have the right to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. Indeed Google has appealed previous (and unrelated) ICO orders with varying success so it should come as no surprise if it were to do so here. No comment has yet been made by the company but with Google facing similar claims across Europe this story may not yet be over.

Boy you sure have a lot of apps on your phone.Well its my job.Whats your favorite?Oh I couldnt choose. But hey want to see one to set your skin crawling?It was the flush end of a pleasurably hot day  85 degrees in March  and we were all sipping bitter cocktails out in my friends backyard which was both his smoking room beer garden viticetum opossum parlor and barbecue pit. I was enjoying the warm dusk with a group of six of my best friends all of whom seemed interested except for my girlfriend who immediately grimaced.Girls Around Me? Again? she scolded. Dont show them that.She turned to our friends apologetically.Hes become obsessed with this app. Its creepy.I sputtered I nevered and I denied it but it was true. I hadbecome obsessed with Girls Around Me an app that perfectly distills many of the most worrying issues related to social networking privacy and the rise of the smartphone into a perfect case study that anyone can understand.Its an app that can be interpreted many ways. It is as innocent as it is insidious; it is just as likely to be reacted to with laughter as it is with tears; it is as much of a novelty as it has the potential to be used a tool for rapists and stalkers.And more than anything its a wake-up call about privacy.The only way to really explain Girls Around Me to people is to load it up and show them how it works so I did. I placed my iPhone on the table in front of everyone and opened the app.The splash screen elicited laughter all around. Its such a bitmap paean to the tackiest and most self-parodying of baller culture; it might as well be an app Tom Haverford slapped together in Parks And Recreation. But it does at a glance sum up what Girls Around Me is all about: a radar overlaid on top of a Google Map out of which throbs numerous holographic women posing like pole dancers in a perpetual state of undress.Okay so heres the way the app works I explained to my friends.Girls Around Me is a standard geolocation based maps app similar to any other app that attempts to alert you to things of interest in your immediate vicinity: whether it be parties clubs deals or what have you. When you load it up the first thing Girls Around Me does is figure out where you are and load up a Google Map centered around your location. The rest of the interface is very simple: in the top left corner theres a button that looks like a radar display at the right corner theres a fuel meter (used to fund the apps freemium model) and on the bottom left is a button that allows you to specify between whether youre interested in women men or both.Its when you push the radar button that Girls Around Me does what it says on the tin. I pressed the button for my friends. Immediately Girls Around Me went into radar mode and after just a few seconds the map around us was filled with pictures of girls who were in the neighborhood. Since I was showing off the app on a Saturday night there were dozens of girls out on the town in our local area.Girls Around Me's splash screen (left) and geo-maps interface (right). Lots of girls around the MFA.Wait what? Are these girls prostitutes? one of my friends asked which given the Matrix-like silhouettes posing on the splash screen was a pretty good question.Oh no I replied. These are just regular girls. See this girl? Her names Zoe. She lives on the same street as me and Brittany. She works at a coffee shop and Im pretty sure she doesnt moonlight picking up tricks.How does it know where these girls are? Do you know all these girls? Is it plucking data from your address book or something? another friend asked.Not at all. These are all girls with publicly visible Facebook profiles who have checked into these locations recently using Foursquare. Girls Around Me then shows you a map where all the girls in your area trackable by Foursquare area. If theres more than one girl at a location you see the number of girls there in a red bubble. Click on that and you can see pictures of all the girls who are at that location at any given time. The pictures you are seeing are their social network profile pictures.Okay so they know that their data can be used like this for anyone to see? Theyre okay with it? Probably not actually. The settings determining how visible your Facebook and Foursquare data is are complicated and tend to be meaningless to people who dont really understand issues about privacy I explained. Most privacy settings on social networks default to share everything with everyone and since most people never change those well they end up getting sucked up into apps like this.But they know theyve checked in right?Again not necessarily. Foursquare lets you check other people into a location. If you get checked into Foursquare by a friend without your knowledge and have a publicly visible Facebook profile you could end up in here. (Update: Apparently I wasnt correct about this. Foursquare does NOT allow you to check other people in with you without their knowledge; I was confusing Foursquare for Facebook which does offer this functionality. Thanks for the correction unknown8bit!  JRB)One of my less computer-affable friends actually went pale and kept on shooting her boyfriend looks for assurance. A Linux aficionado who was the only person in our group without a Facebook account (and one of the few people Id ever met who actually endorsed Diaspora) the look he returned was one of comical smugness.But wait! It gets worse! I said ramping things up.So lets say Im a bro looking to go out for a night on the town and pick someone up. Lets say Im going to the Independent around the corner and checking it out ahead of time I really like the look of this girl Zoe  she looks like a girl I might want to try to get with tonight  so I tap her picture for more information see what I can find out about here.I tapped on Zoe. Girls Around Me quickly loaded up a fullscreen render of her Facebook profile picture. The app then told me where Zoe had last been seen (The Independent) and when (15 minutes ago). A big green button at the bottom reading Photos & Messaging just begged to be tapped and when I did I was whisked away to Zoes Facebook profile.Okay so heres Zoe. Most of her information is visible so I now know her full name. I can see at a glance that shes single that she is 24 that she went to Stoneham High School and Bunker Hill Community College that she likes to travel that her favorite book is Gone With The Wind and her favorite musician is Tori Amos and that shes a liberal. I can see the names of her family and friends. I can see her birthday.All of that is visible on Facebook? one of the other girls in our group asked.More depending on how your privacy settings are configured! For example I can also look at Zoes pictures.I tapped on the photo album and a collection of hundreds of publicly visible photos loaded up. I quickly browsed them.Okay so it looks like Zoe is my kind of girl. From her photo albums I can see that she likes to party and given the number of guys she takes photos with at bars and clubs at night I can deduce that shes frisky when shes drunk and her favorite drink is a frosty margarita. She appears to have recently been in Rome. Also since her photo album contains pictures she took at the beach I now know what Zoe looks like in a bikini which as it happens is pretty damn good.My girlfriend scowled at me. I assured her Zoe in a bikini was no comparison and moved on.So now I know everything to know about Zoe. I know where she is. I know what she looks like both clothed and mostly disrobed. I know her full name her parents full names her brothers full name. I know what she likes to drink. I know where she went to school. I know what she likes and dislikes. All I need to do now is go down to the Independent ask her if she remembers me from Stoneham High ask her how her brother Mike is doing buy her a frosty margarita and start waxing eloquently about that beautiful summer I spent in Roma.The Girls of Girls Around Me. It's doubtful any of these girls even know they are being tracked. Their names and locations have been obscured for privacy reasons.Throughout this demonstration my group of friends had been split pretty evenly along gender lines in their reactions. Across the board the men either looked amused or (in the case of my beardo Diaspora friend) philosophically pleased with themselves about their existing opinions about social networking. The women on the other hand looked sick and horrified.It was at this point though that the tendrils of the girls unease  their deeply empathic sense of someone being unsafe  seemed to creep through the entire group.And if that doesnt work on Zoe I concluded consulting the app one last time. There are  lets see  nine other girls at the Independent tonight.Often times a writer uses tricks and exaggerations to convey to a reader the spirit  if not the precise truth  of what occurred. I just want to make clear that when I say that one of my friends was actually on the verge of tears you understand that this is not such a trick. She was horrified to the point of crying.How can Apple let people download an app like this? she asked. And have you written about this?In answer to the first question I replied that as sleazy as this app seemed Girls Around Me wasnt actually doing anything wrong. Sure on the surface it looks like a hook-up app like Grindr for potential stalkers and date rapists but all that Girls Around Me is really doing is using public APIs from Google Maps Facebook and Foursquare and mashing them all up together so you could see who had checked-in at locations in your area and learn more about them. Moreover the girls (and men!) shown in Girls Around Me all had the power to opt out of this information being visible to strangers but whether out of ignorance apathy or laziness they had all neglected to do so. This was all public information. Nothing Girls Around Me does violates any of Apples policies.In fact Girls Around Me wasnt even the real problem.Its not really that were all horrified by what this app does is it? I asked finishing my drink. Its that were all horrified by how exposed these girls are and how exposed services like Facebook and Foursquare let them be without their knowledge.But I didnt have an easy answer ready for my friends last question. Id been playing with the app for almost two months. Why hadnt I written about it? None of the answers made me look good.Part of it was because like many tech professionals I had taken for granted that people understood that their Facebook profiles and Foursquare data were publicly visible unless they explicitly said otherwise and like my beardo Diaspora friend I secretly believed that people who were exposed this way on the Internet without their knowledge were foolish.That made Girls Around Me a funny curio a titillating novelty app the kind of thing you pulled out with your buddies at the bar to laugh about and maybe secretly wish had been around when you were younger and single and trying to pull some action. And if Id written a post about it a month ago it would have probably been from that angle. The headline might well have been: No More Sausage Fests With Girls Around Me [Humor]It was in just this spirit that Id shown off the app to my friends in the first place. It was getting late we were all drunk or on the verge of getting there and it had been a perfect day. It would have been so nice to finish things with a laugh. But now as six intelligent sophisticated friends from a variety of backgrounds surrounded me  some looking sick some looking angry and some with genuine fear in their faces  I didnt think Girls Around Me was so funny. It had cast a pall across a beautiful day and it had made people I loved feel scared not just for the people they loved but for complete strangers.So Im writing about it now. Not because Girls Around Me is an evil app that should be pulled from the iOS App Store or because the company that makes it  Moscow-based i-Free  is filled with villains. I still dont believe that theres anything wrong with what this app is doing and the guys at i-Free are super nice and certainly dont mean for this app to be anything beyond a diversion. So the reason Im writing about Girls Around Me is because I finally know what to say about it and what it means in the greater picture.Girls Around Me isnt an app you should use to pick up girls or guys for that matter. This is an app you should download to teach the people you care about that privacy issues are real that social networks like Facebook and Foursquare expose you and the ones you love and that if you do not know exactly how much you are sharing you are as easily preyed upon as if you were naked. I can think of no better way to get a person to realize that they should understand their Facebook privacy settings then pulling out this app.Thats why I hope youll go download Girls Around Me on your iPhone or iPad. Its free to download. Show it to someone. Give them the same demo I gave to my friends. Then when they ask how its done and how they can prevent an app like Girls Around Me from tracking them educate them about privacy.Heres a good place to start.Update: In response to this story Foursquare has killed Girls Around Mes API access to their data effectively knocking the app out of commission. For more details and a statement from Foursquare read here.Update 2: As of Saturday evening Girls Around Me has been yanked from the iOS App Store.Update 3: Girls Around Me developer i-Free has released a full statement on the app in which they say theyve done nothing wrong and been made a scapegoat for privacy issues. You can read their response  and ours  here.Update 4: Think this issues dead now that Girls Around Me has been killed? Its not at all. In fact its very possible Girls Around Me could come back with its core functionality intact.Update 5: Weve written a guide on cutting apps like Foursquare and Facebook off from tracking your data. Read it here.Update 6: Girls Around Mes developer gave Cult of Mac an interview in which they said that the app wasnt for stalking girls without their knowledge but for avoiding women who are ugly.

And they arent aware either. Plus its free.D3vouringPeople are not forced to use Facebook and 4square and by that they dont mind selling their privacy to companies so why are you surprised by such app ?tesseractDo me a favor: re-imagine your example using your own girlfriend instead of a casual acquaintance. Can you still laugh it off and say its fair to use this as a cautionary tale about the hidden dangers of Facebook privacy settings? Does ignorance about the intricacies of Social Media ToS somehow make a person more deserving of rape or assault?As men we are statistically much less likely to ever be the victim of those kinds of crimes. This unfortunately isnt true for our wives or girlfriends our kids or our friends. Does the fact that were not the ones in danger make it ok to laugh it off? If someone you knew and cared about was assaulted and you found out an app like this facilitated it would you still take this kind of stance?I get that youre trying in a roundabout way to raise awareness- but is it really necessary to encourage people to download this app? I dont really know a lot about the profit model of this kind of thing- I assume it may be ad-based  but I really cant see how you encouraging downloads doesnt help the company and that seems incredibly irresponsible.DougI think that people who are using these services such as Facebook or Foursquare are aware that information about themselves is exposed but my guess is that they think that exposure is limited to the confines of those sites/applications. That is people who are on facebook can see the information I posted to facebook about myself. Same with Foursquare.However what they very likely dont know about are things called APIs which is just technical mumbo-jumbo to most people. And they dont understand how these APIs allow for information to be aggregated from multiple sources about multiple individuals into a completely non-related app.John I think you give the developers of this app a little too much moral credit by assuming its just a gag and in good fun and that they are great guys. At best they are commodifying women and showing a complete lack of respect for their privacy  its an attitude of hey theyre around for our entertainment and a good laugh! Its pretty gross frankly. If I wouldnt want one of these great guys knowing about my sister or daughter or female friends  they all deserve better.unknown8bitFoursquare doesnt allow you to check other people in; youll want to correct that. Facebook lets you check your friends in and it will show up on their profile if left on default privacy settings.mdzimmWe might be horrified by what this app does. We might indeed be horrified by how easy it is to find information about us on the web.But what makes these things horrifying is the point of view they represent. Its the reminder that its both common and socially acceptable for men to see the world this way: with women in their crosshairs. Software developers will even build tools to make it easier and well shrug it off because they arent treading on Apples business interests (phew!). Its the fact that men will even consider it *funny*!The app is scary because of the demand and the approval that it represents.kersypantsInteresting that the revelation that something was seriously wrong with this app when women were literally breaking down instead of sitting smug and amused prompted you to question privacy education first and not knock you dumbstruck at your privilege and ignorance of rape culture and its extent.John BrownleeFoursquare doesnt allow you to check other people in; youll want to correct that. Facebook lets you check your friends in and it will show up on their profile if left on default privacy settings.Thanks Ive made the correction. Youre right: I was getting confused with Foursquare.TekLawI am surprised by some of the comments left here.
There are likely several more apps similar to Girls Around Me and more apps will continue to be created and made available to those who are interested. As an in-house attorney at a large semiconductor company I commend you for this article and hope that more readers understand the reason you have written it.
It certainly is a great reminder that the law has not caught up with technology and we should all make ourselves aware of our social networking (and other public portals) privacy settings especially with regard to Location Based Services apps.PillbugAs men we are statistically much less likely to ever be the victim of those kinds of crimes. This unfortunately isnt true for our wives or girlfriends our kids or our friends. Does the fact that were not the ones in danger make it ok to laugh it off? If someone you knew and cared about was assaulted and you found out an app like this facilitated it would you still take this kind of stance?t I really cant see how you encouraging downloads doesnt help the company and that seems incredibly irresponsible.You are the one being irresponsible. This baloney sociological navel-gazing is exactly what gets people in trouble. Knowledge is the answer. Just as you dont leave your door open at night people need to learn to control their exposure. Blaming an app for sexual assault is insane. Just as wearing skimpy clothing doesnt cause rape neither does an application. But my previous point stands. It is only going to get worse and people needt o learn to control the info they distribute. Creating new laws is asinine.myfreewebi-Free is still around? I remember i-Free selling ringtones and pictures and J2ME games through SMS payments and WAP downloads! I remember how all the kids in Moscow googled free stuff instead and sent to each other via Bluetooth!Now the app is a good demonstration of default privacy settings. I guess the sexism was added to get more popularity. (Which is sad.)We need a campaign to promote privacy. I remember how I used Foursquare  no full name no photo checking in after leaving. Why arent others doing the same?Luiza PradoMr. Brownlee are you SERIOUS when you say that the creators of the app had no malicious intentions? Seriously? When women are represented in stripper poses on the splash screen? When women are presented as targets mere objects for a mans enjoyment?The developers of this app ARE RESPONSIBLE for promoting and perpetuating sexism. Sexism is not only for rapists. Sexism is not only for the guy who punches his girlfriend. Seeing women as targets IS sexist. Using an app to pretend youre someone youre not in order to get into a girls pants IS sexist. And all of these behaviours that objectify women enable things like rape and violence.MsTeeq74I agree that the intent wasnt malicious.
As far as how the women appear in sillouette form thats not the software developers problem thats the worlds problem.
Just look at the ads we see on bilboards in stores etc.
The app is appealing to men and if you think that non-rapist men arent attracted to sexy sillouettes Id like to know where youve been if you actually know a man. lol
A guy liking how a sexy sillouette looks doesnt make him a creeper or a bad guy. SMH
I agree with the author 100% which is why after being stalked by a random female co-worker (Thank you creeper chick who I used to work with who for some unknown and strange reason FB stalked me) I put a VERY tight restriction on my privacy settings.
I am happy to know that when someone pulls up Girls Around Me my profile WONT be one of the sexy sillouettes shown in their radar. lol
I dont really understand why people DONT use the privacy settingsmake their information more restrictive.
Wellthen again I didnt either until I was stalked by ex-co-worker creepy chick. o_o
GREAT article!MoniqueIm frankly horrified that you played with this app and considered it amusing for 2 months (despite the disapproval of your girlfriend who recognized your interest as creepy) and that it took a woman you know starting to cry for you to notice that objectifying women in this way is an upsetting concept.
It is not JUST that it is horrifying that these women are so exposed it is also horrifying to many of us (and I find it very demoralizing that its not horrifying to everyone) that such an app would be designed and used because it shows there is a market for tools to help men who view women as prey hunt them down. Best-case scenario the users would be dishonest only through lies of omission (since telling a woman you found her using a tool that depicts naked ladies on miitary-inspired radar screens is pretty much guaranteed to send her screaming for help) but there is such an obvious potential for trickery that its impossible to think that was not intended by the creators. The suggestion that anyone involved in a product that depicts women as writhing nudes in the crosshairs could be a nice guy and simply not have considered the fact that they were objectifying women in a way designed to appeal to sexist and possibly predatory men is either disingenuous or displays an appalling lack of empathy or compassion for women.
I agree with tesseract that it is completely irresponsible to suggest that anyone download this app or support this company in any way!
A FAR better suggestion would be that women (and men too although I suspect they are targeted much less often) reconsider their privacy settings. If you know Zoe and it didnt occur to you to message her and let her know that her information is set to public you might want to reconsider whether you are a nice guy yourself.
Although given your admission that you might have used such an app to prey on women in your single days perhaps you already know that youre not.Contrarian@mdzimm and others  please leave the sexism against men out of this. Ill rephrase your point for you:But what makes these things horrifying is the point of view they represent. Its the reminder that its both common and socially acceptable for people to see the world this way: with other people towards whom they express a sexual preference in their crosshairsAll the time we remain human we will have a sexuality that can be exploited by apps like this. The problem is not that we are human; its that there is a massive problem with privacy law being framed in an entirely wrong way so that corporations can get away with abusing our privacy.MoniqueContrarian this app is clearly marketed at men seeking women.
It may allow searches for males but its called Girls Around Me not People Around Me or even Women Around Me which might have been less sexist choices.
If you think its sexist to notice sexism youre missing the point.
My beef is not with compassionate honest men like my husband or brothers-in-law or with men in general. Its with the men who download and use this app or others like it.tesseractAs men we are statistically much less likely to ever be the victim of those kinds of crimes.

Creating new laws is asinine.Pillbug I fail to see how Im being irresponsible but thats probably because youre barely coherent.Knowledge is the answer is a gross oversimplification. I entirely agree that people should learn to better understand the implications of social media but considering how quickly (and often) those implications are changing its unreasonable to expect every citizen to have an iron grip on the subject. The companies and technologies facilitating the way this information is distributed arent exactly transparent and thats by design. Id love to believe that at some point in the future everyone will get it and be able to better protect themselves. In the meantime I absolutely do not believe that ignorance of Facebooks fine print is a justification for its users being endangered and exploited.At no point in my original post did I blame this app for sexual assault but to deny that it could be used to facilitate it is willfully ignorant. You state (correctly) that wearing skimpy clothing doesnt cause rape but equivocating that with the idea that apps like this cant facilitate it is a false analogy. To clarify: claiming that wearing skimpy clothing DOES cause rape is blaming the victim (which is wrong). Claiming that an app which allows predatory individuals to to stalk women without their knowledge is holding the aggressor responsible (which is correct).As for baloney sociological navel-gazing I cant even begin to unravel what you mean. Im offering statistical facts and talking about the way that those realities affect our outlook. If you want to talk about navel-gazing consider your own lack of perspective. If you want to talk about baloney consider your own inability to craft an argument.metro72So the whole point of Foursquare is to let other people know where youre at and people get a kick out of that for whatever reason.
So to be amazed/astonished/ashamed of people being able to see where you are at when you specifically went out and installed an app to let people do that is pretty much your bad.On the Facebook side yes I do believe many people have no idea what they post is visible to others.
But if you dont know think twice before you randomly put it out there on the web.
Hopefully articles such as this will at least get people to look into the security of what they are sharing.
If nothing else create a separate account that you can use to test against your real account to see what is displayed or is searchable by all.As far as this app is concerned its functionality is not too different from many others  read the Color app  that seek to combine the social media data in an aggregate form that they believe is real intention of having social media tools in the first place.
The problem is they do go about presenting some of it in a rather grotesque fashion  i.e. the pole dance images  that is pretty inappropriate right there and one of the many reasons a man would find himself in a divorce situation if his wife found an app like this on his phone.
By the way if you search for guys does it put up images of male dancers?Anyway in the authors defense of every woman who is mad that he said he would have loved to have an app like this when he was younger.
I assure you that the boys today are trying their darndest to find a girl to show them the time of day as hard as they can.
If not for apps like this they would be looking elsewhere i.e. traversing lists of people they dont know who like things in FB just to see if they have a nice profile picture and an open account that lets them see more.
If they decided to link Foursquare to that account even better for them I guess.
10 years ago the same boys would be trying to find out as much about a girl as they could via other means watching what clubs they frequent what time they usually go to the gym when are their classes so they might run into each other talking to her friends etc.
The only difference with this app is that it lets APIs do the hard work for them incidentally masking their possibly shady identity at the same time.Had the developers not made the app so degrading to women in depicting the pole dancers there would probably be a lot more users because many women may not have paid attention to it and seen it as just another social networking app  despite the also guilty name of the app I suppose (they put red flags up all over the place).
Had they called it PeepsNearMe and stripped the gratuitus icons they probably could have made a fortune with a much larger userbase and people wouldnt have gotten nearly as offended.
Oh wait but then it would be almost the same thing as FoursquareMichael BauserIm not sure your technical description of how the app gets womens location is correct. I dont see where the Facebook API lets you search pubic posts by location  I just tried it and got a The location_post table does not support search error. Also Foursquare doesnt push latitude/longitude to Facebook yet which means Girls Around Me would be depending on women to check in on Foursquare AND Facebook in order to search Facebook for nearby people. That cant possibly work!Furthermore if the app was only searching Facebook it wouldnt NEED to make you join Foursquare as its website says. Best I can figure is that theyre using a really crazy search loop where they search Foursquare (and/or Facebook) for popular places near you then look up those places one by one on Foursquare (which unlike Facebook has an easy-to-access Whos here now list for every location).I cant play with the app because it doesnt have an Android version yet. Somebody check: Does it EVER find women who dont have Facebook profiles? If so thats a sign its not using Facebook as the primary locator method.Joe ThompsonThis is not a problem of new data but of new access to and combination of existing data and its popping up a lot.
For example our county clerk started to put all county records online.
You can now instantly see for example the transfer history of a property you want to buy.
Except a lot of old mortgage and deed records had SSNs written on them.
Oops.The problem was not that the documents were put online it was that SSNs were ever put on a public document in the first place.
(Which was admittedly back in the kinder gentler days before your SSN was the key to *all* your confidential medical financial and legal data.)
A similar example  the county tax office has had tax record searches online for years.
So with a name or even in some cases a partial name and a little bit of location info (say knowing what general neighborhood they live in) you can find out somebodys address and entire tax history (which can give an approximate read on their finances)  its a stalkers dream and not much to be done about it because any schmoe can go down to the tax office and browse the records by law.Note that in both cases the current state of the online version of those records is (now) more secure than the paper versions  like I said up top its not easy online access thats the issue its the content access is given to that needs a good scrubbing.rwfsmithThis app doesnt do anything that you couldnt have done with with the slightly more effort of checking Foursquare and Facebook separately. I think this may be an important step in getting people educated on their internet privacy  especially those who are not very well versed in how the internet and social networking sites function.I could see why he didnt think much of it for a couple months I probably wouldnt have either. The first thing I and many other technically capable people do when they sign up for an account on a web page is actually read the EULA then configure privacy settings. This is something that EVERYBODY should be doing.PillbugAs for baloney sociological navel-gazing I cant even begin to unravel what you mean. Im offering statistical facts and talking about the way that those realities affect our outlook. If you want to talk about navel-gazing consider your own lack of perspective. If you want to talk about baloney consider your own inability to craft an argument.Yes well your argument was to get on the interwebs and play the scold by castigating an e-mag writer for writing about the field in which he works and providing valuable information to those who would be seemingly affected. To accuse someone of being irresponsible for providing this information doesnt make much sense nor is there any reason to suppose that someone downloading this app or any other app akin to this due to reading here is more (or less) likely to commit a sexual assault. The technology is there; it could be this app or any other. I dont buy that sexual assaults are likely to occur because of this anyway.I was on and off the fence about stalking and assaulting one of the folks in my neighborhood but Girls Around Me really gave me the push I needed.No  your thought is based on emotion and the seeming creepiness of the application but frankly Facebook is one big (pseudo) stalkers paradise. There simply is no evidence outside of ones own thoughts that this application is likely to result in an increase in sexual or other kinds of assaults.(As a side note I would be more concerned about robberies stemming from a gender neutral rendition as relative wealth and jewelry can be spoted but frankly does that really make casing a place any easier? no.)artlungThe context is the part of that thats creepy. Stripper Matrix splash screen really sells it as stalking / hook-up tool. http://www.sonar.me/ does some of what you have there but does it in a way thats more interest based and links you to people based on number of social network connections / twitter follows you share. It does a pretty good job of that but as far as I know only uses explicit check ins by the user to find people.Jason Brian ChapaITS DISGUSTINGthat this isnt available for Android.GirlontheHillThanks to John Brownlee (yay!) Foursquare bans Girls Around me for API violation. Ha!http://tnw.co/H4HH6CPillbugNote that in both cases the current state of the online version of those records is (now) more secure than the paper versions  like I said up top its not easy online access thats the issue its the content access is given to that needs a good scrubbing.Sure this is the old case where it has been proven again and again that given a set of data and auxilliary data an individual can be readily identified.However in this case the individuals are readily linking the data sets together and this is not a case of probabilistic record matching.If anything apps like this are doing the public a massive favour by taking off their blinders about what they do in the public sphere and that public sphere is online sometimes.Liz RizzoShorter this article: Public information is public.Steve_LockstepShorter this article: Public information is public.Short.
And wrong. See http://lockstep.com.au/blog/2011/01/26/public-yet-still-private.htmlDo you know that some jurisdictions have the offence of theft by finding? If I find a bag full of money in the street I am not in fact free to pick it up and keep it.
Counter intuitive for some but thats the law.Equally you might intuit that personal information in the public domain is no longer private. And youd be wrong on that.Steve_LockstepLots of people take a defeatist position based on the idea that the data is out there.
Others withdraw trying to hide behind Tor and the like going to extraordinary lengths to hide their tracks to thwart the information raiders.Theres a middle way.
The foundation of OECD data protection is three fold: (1) Dont collect Personal Information that you dont need (2) Be open with individuals about what PI you have and why and (3) Once collected refrain from using PI for unrelated secondary purposes.That last one the Use Limitation Principle creates an extra layer of protection around data that is already out there or which is in the public domain (importantly many Information Privacy Laws dont turn on the terms public and private).
Even if people have used Foursquare without thinking through where their exuberance might lead Use Limitation says its not OK for Girls Around Me to mine that data and use it without control.
The Use Limitation Principle also says that snapshots acquired by Facebook cannot be mined without consent using facial recognition to work out new data linkages. And that Google cannot hoover up unencrypted wifi transmissions just because theyre in the public domain.The fact that huge amounts of data about me is out there does not nullify my rights to privacy even if I put it out there myself.
I dont want to live my life online anonymously; I do want to socialise online.
I want limits on what third parties can do with the knowledge they have about me.
Its about control and respect not secrecy and anonymity.
We can have Foursquare and still put the brakes on insanity like Girls Around Me.http://lockstep.com.au/blog/privacy.htmltesseractYes well your argument was to get on the interwebs and play the scold by castigating an e-mag writer for writing about the field in which he works and providing valuable information to those who would be seemingly affected.Actually the thing I took issue with was the fact that he encouraged his readers to download the app which is abundantly clear from my post. I admitted to not knowing the details of how an app like this generates profit but even without knowing that its easy to understand that increasing the circulation of the app has to somehow benefit the producers. Were he really trying to help those who would be seemingly affected he wouldnt have encouraged people to do something that would increase the distribution of this app. I dont think it was intentional on his part and I think his aim was good  just not thought through. To accuse someone of being irresponsible for providing this information doesnt make much sense nor is there any reason to suppose that someone downloading this app or any other app akin to this due to reading here is more (or less) likely to commit a sexual assault.Nice strawman fallacy. I never insinuated that this app would make someone more likely to commit a sexual assault. What I said is that the app *facilitates* sexual assault as in makes it easier for someone who already has the intent. Is that a good thing in your eyes? Is there some ethical or respectful use for this program that Im missing?No  your thought is based on emotion and the seeming creepiness of the applicationSeeming? Seriously?There simply is no evidence outside of ones own thoughts that this application is likely to result in an increase in sexual or other kinds of assaults.Theres a big difference between a site that has the potential to be used in a certain way and an app that is clearly designed specifically for that kind of use. As for evidence youre trying to say two things at once and failing at both so let me help you. As for causing an increase in assaults as in the drives mild-mannered men to become racists sense that you conjured above it is exactly that: made-up hyperbole. In terms of whether an application specifically designed to make it easier for a stranger to follow a woman without her consent or knowledge could lead to that increase: I wont say I have evidence onhand because I dont. But it doesnt feel like much of a stretch.(As a side note I would be more concerned about robberies stemming from a gender neutral rendition as relative wealth and jewelry can be spoted but frankly does that really make casing a place any easier? no.)Welcome to gender privilege. The fact that you (I assume) a male are more concerned about being robbed than you are being raped is exactly the point.IndigoSwashRe: Update: In response to this story Foursquare has killed Girls Around Mes API access to their data effectively knocking the app out of commission. For more details and a statement from Foursquare read here.  Both links in this update just redirect back to this same post.PillbugWelcome to gender privilege. The fact that you (I assume) a male are more concerned about being robbed than you are being raped is exactly the point.Ah one of the privilege people who sit around with their associates accusing various people of various forms of privilege online ad infinitum  impossible to deal with as when logic runs out there is always that to throw out which is what it always comes down to in the end.A) I am male B) I have been assaulted but will leave details way to the side C) The presumption would be that the overwhelming preponderance of sexual assault occurs in ones home whereas robbery for jewelry and money is overwhelmingly a public affair if we are talking about assault that involves the physical presence of victim. Women are also more likely to be held up at gun point or mugged so your claim of privilege is a red herring.My point abundantly clear was that the article was responsible by encouraging people to gain knowledge regarding the devices and applications they use and that discouraging that is counterintuitive. Frankly the people who most should be downloading this or other parallel apps are those who would be seemingly affected. The last thing the author was was irresponsible.Jim Hyslop(I hope this isnt a duplicate post my apologies if it appears twice)Its find for Foursquare to ban GAM but what about the next app that comes along? Banning individual apps doesnt solve the underlying problem.Jim HyslopActually the thing I took issue with was the fact that he encouraged his readers to download the app which is abundantly clear from my post.Given the tone of the article I interpreted that to mean that he was encouraging us to do the same as he did: demonstrate to your friends what the problem is and make sure they check their privacy settings.mainemacuserPlease enlighten me. What is an opossum parlor?web2point0guyAn application platform syngergizing location APIs dating and social media? This guy needs to find some venture capitalist funding!Goo ToorHmmcould have been a successful app if it was called FRIENDS around me ;)aks25John Ive been on the receiving end of being stalked online and I can assure you that had you chatted up Zoe in real life it would probably have been obvious to her that you didnt know her and shed likely have enough social acuity to pick up on someone posing as a long-lost friend.I once had a job interviewer try to strike up some small talk when we met in her office for the first time after being sutted out for a half hour by other HR staff people.
I heard youre into blah blah and blah pretending to have learned it from another of the human-resources staffers I talked with earlier. No I explained to her Im not into any of that stuff but the guy across town with the same full name as me that you found when you Google-stalked me before the interview does like all those things.The look of horror on her face was priceless.I walked out on her immediately about 20 seconds into the interview.The real shame with this app is that it could have been tremendously useful and its basic functionality wouldnt seem so creepy to many of us had it not been wrapped in scantily-clad laser-targeted imagery.aks25Oh also I wonder how many ppl creeped out by Girls Around Me dont think twice about using those grocery-store savings club discount cards which I know about from working behind the scenes.
You dont want to know how all the info theyre collecting on you is being aggregated and sifted through  say your smoking habit (you buy two packs a week) your ethnicity (passover food = youre Jewish) how old your kids are (you bought a birthday card for a 4-year-old daughter) that youre trying for another kid (you bought an ovulation predictor kit) or not (you bought condoms) or maybe youre having trouble in that department (your wife has a prescription for Clomid and you for Viagra) etc. etc.Grocery store discount cards way creepier than Girls Around Me IMO.phineasThe app features an image of strippers and refers to girls around the user and youve admitted its a way for men using it to pull some action.It absolutely should be pulled its horribly sexist.The fact that people are comparing shopping apps to apps allowing someone to stalk women shows how serious this problem is (as if women are no different from things to be bought). Wake up women. Start noticing these things (the way men think of us) and start doing something about it. This is not fun and games.TallDaveMy God! Men hitting on women!
What has the world come to?If men are allowed to see women as sexual targets no attractive woman will ever be safe from being showered with attention gifts money and favors by interested men!
Do we really want to live in a world where an unsuspecting woman might have doors opened flat tires changed or chairs pulled out for her  just because shes a woman?If this is allowed to go on some unscrupulous women might even sell their pictures show their bodies for money or even acquire wealth through sexual favors!In summary men should be chemically castrated and the Internet should be illegal because it makes me feel unsafe.Michael Bauserhttp://www.sonar.me/ does some of what you have there but does it in a way thats more interest based and links you to people based on number of social network connections / twitter follows you share. It does a pretty good job of that but as far as I know only uses explicit check ins by the user to find people.I feel like you got this EXACTLY backwards. Girls Around Me only uses explicit check ins in that it only locates women who use Foursquare. The newest version of Sonar (much like Banjo) uses Twitters search nearby API to find geotagged tweets. Many of those will be Foursquare checkins but not all of them. Sonar is the one the finding people who havent explicitly checked in to a location not Girls Around Me.Whether or not the app is finding explicit check-ins is not Girls Around Mes real problem. The real problem is that it treats women as a sexual commodity and that upsets people.(Right now judging by Twitter Banjo is getting some Girls Around Me comparisons but nobody has dissed Sonar yet.)fLaMePr0oFI completely and totally agree on the privacy issues here but I have to say Im almost as worried by the casual advocation of restriction and censoring of such media  as it happens the app was closed down because the developer in question had breached a minor clause of the terms governing Foursquares public APIs but what the author said is basically still true; they hadnt done anything wrong or inappropriate by using public APIs to put an app like this out.If every time some negative use or means of abusing new media comes to light our reaction is to immediately demand the offending products/platforms (which are often peoples livelihoods) be taken down rather than looking at the root causes of potential issues and trying to improve / fix privacy policies and educate users we impoverish our world and ourselves with clumsy and unnecessary barriers restrictions and controls.Its interesting that this article appeared in The Cult of Mac as Apple and the way it runs its business partnerships and media platforms such as iTunes and App Store often exemplify this flawed dictatorial walled garden approach.There are a lot of people in our society today however who very much want to see these sort of solutions to perceived problems and so we have nanny state interference reduced liberties and excessive surveillance & control which ultimately leads to the degradation of privacy and basic freedoms rather than their protection and enhancement.matt45Thanks for this post.
One way also to fight the perspective this app perpetuates (in images as well as in words) is to stop calling adult women girls as in the following quote (and in the name of the app itself):Moreover the girls (and men!) shown in Girls Around Me all had the power to opt out of this information being visible to strangersGirls and men obviously arent parallel terms.
Women Around Me would at least potentially level the playing field in the prowlers mind.pinky38Thanks for writing this article.

But Nooooooo you got to WRITE about it!Well you got my nomination for dickhead of the year!THANKS A LOT!Emma WehlingWhat I think is sad is that there is apparently a significant number of people that would fall for someone pretending to know them. I know who I know and someone pretending to know a family member or go to my school wouldnt make him any more likely to get in my pants. Id still think he was a creepjust sayinjazzyalexCreepy app  what a bullshit.
What was creepy there if you can open Foursquare go to any nearby venue (e.g. night club) see checked in women (men) and browse through their Facebook timelines if the link is present in their 4Square profile?
If you decide to check in in 4Square AND have a link to your FB profile you are willingly let other people to see your photos/posts/whatever public FB info.EmmaGeralnThis app is a step too far it aggregates informations and glamorises and gamifys creepy stalking. Im disappointed (but not surprised) that Apple let this into the app store in the first place.Mr_JamesTechnical determinism / technical neutrality. Dont doom the developer for coding a powerful tool as you can use the app in the way the programmer intend it or you can misuse it. Its in theory the same wit a baseball bat: hit a ball or break someones neck.If the app was allowed by the strict rules of Apple in the first place the app should be considered legal.When joining a social network every user should try to emphasize the importance of privacy options and not sharing every single moment of their life on Facebook. Its dangerous  and its not the fault of this app. You dont need this app to stalk a girl. You just need accounts on FS and FB to find out whos around and the information about them. The app was just a tool which made these things easier. Think about it before sharing underwear photos and tagging you in a club on Saturday night.Best regards.Zippity8John thanks for alerting us to the kinds of things that are out there. As for those that have a problem with the apps demise ask yourself how youd feel if your mother/sister/wife/daughter was stalked and hurt because of this app or one like it.BPMarkusJohn. There is something wrong with you if you still dont think theres anything wrong with what the good ole boys at i-Free are doing after seeing the terrified reaction of your female friends. Im glad you think the men who created this app are super nice but I hope you understand they have created something that makes it quick and easy to stalk women like game. There is something further wrong with you that you decided to sit on the information instead of letting people know as soon as you knew because this is in fact a safety issue. You write from the chauvinist perspective of a man who has never experienced the bone-chilling fear of being stalked or has never had to worry about the thousands of thousands of women who go missing in this country only to be found dead or never found at all.Adrian MayJust one factor youre missing: Zoe wants somebody to go hit on her. Otherwise she wouldnt be sharing her location; in fact she probably wouldnt be in the bar at all. And whats wrong with that? People have to meet each other somehow. What was so great about yelling in the ear of a complete stranger in a sweaty night club like we had to before this stuff was invented? Maybe shed rather be approached by somebody whos already been warned about what shed look like in a bikini and might have picked her out because he has similar interests. Perhaps youre more likely to approach her if you can ask her about Rome instead of grappling for cliche chat up lines.Adrian.Adrian MayI bet Im a lot older than you but even I can see that young people dont see this as some kind of Big Brother machine peeping on their privacy; theyre using it quite deliberately to advertise themselves and communicate and they are not terrified by the idea of other people knowing where they go on holiday. Do you feel intruded upon by me reading your blog? Of course not  you work night and day to promote it. I dont mind people reading this post but I sure as hell objected when I signed into this blogging engine using my facebook ID and it even asked for permission to make facebook posts in my name. Now thats creepy!fermata18I refuse to accept that people cant take responsibility for protecting their own privacy on their profiles just because they arent tech-savvy. This is not about reading the fine print of Facebook or Foursquares privacy policies and knowing the voodoo magic it apparently takes to protect oneself from stalkers. This is about common sense and users of these sites  both men and women  ought to have more of it.Woody BrownYou said nothing about the real problem.
That is: the opt-out paradigm employed by businesses on their customers.
No service feature or functionality ought be opt-out everything needs be default set to opt-in.This way only opting-in do customers both knowingly and voluntarially submit themselves to what-ever the things is.
No auto-renewals based on opt-out paradigms no public defaults no assumption that the customer wants or needs your product service feature or function.
It is an immoral way to make money unless consumers expressly opt-out (on time) to avoid being defaulted into giving-over any-freaking-thing to anybody any organization or any program.Opt-in is the only ethical business standard.Andrew Broughgood article way too long though. you could have said all of that with less words.remember: less is more. that was kinda painful to readfloatingA lot of people are agreeing that this is not the fault of the app because sites like facebook already have this information and you can already see it  tell me exactly HOW easy is it to find out where people are in physical proximity to you and bring that up on facebook? This app most distinctly enables you to track a person and lists people in a way that facebook does NOT in any way that I have ever seen. I do not know much about foursquare but telling friends where you currently are with other friends and allowing people who know enough about you to look you up by name or association and then see your profile is VERY different from what this Girls Around Me app is doing (though reading other posts I can see that maybe FS does allow you to track random people like this).Sure it might have just been a funny novelty that the nice guys making it didnt think much about but the actual PURPOSE of it is to look up Girls Around Me (or guys). It really should be opt-in. I can see how that could be a fun or useful social mechanism that I could see people WANTING to participate in but it doesnt really change that 1) it is also an enabler 2) that a lot of young people leave their information public because they dont know about the existence of such apps and 3) that one in four college-age women have been sexually assaulted. Is that the apps fault? No not at all but it does enable creeps and Im not sure why anyone is defending that the app does not.Megan SwaineIts not like that stuff couldnt be done WITHOUT the app. Say Im at a Jack Astors in Toronto across from the Scotiabank theater and I go on Twitter and search Jack Astors Toronto. It immediately gives me two tweeted Foursquare check-ins both made in the past two hours. One of which is a girl who is at the same restaurant as me. Her photo is in her Twitter profile. Her bio outs her as some kind of blogger meaning I could probably find more about her on the Internet if I tried.Get what Im saying? (and Im a girl btw) Its not about the app. Its about the information the app is using- information which is deliberately put out there by people who obviously arent considering the consequences.I mean Foursquare is expressly designed to share your locationpublicly. Thats what its for. Its not like theres anything deceptive about what it does.macewan@CultOfMac The apptap widget on this page is advertising Girls Around Me as an App to download.Livia Song@Adrian Mayyou are the exact definition of a douchebag. it should not matter what the girl is wearing or if shes asking for it you do not rape her period. Its not a matter of teaching girls not to get raped its a matter of teaching men not to rape. Youre the perfect example of someone who slut shames and victim blames. You are saying that all of the girls that have neglected to change their privacy settings are asking for it and need to be taught a lesson. Why do they need to change their privacy settings in the first place? Precisely to avoid people like you. Youre disgustingHodgePretty damn telling that the name of the app is GIRLS Around Me when it can also be used to find men. If it had been marketed as People Around Me it would have been a flop.Fabien@Livia Song: Unless I missed this post Adrian May didnt talk about rape he was obviously talking about dating. He never said these girls needed to be taught a lesson he said they probably know what they are doing when they check in into 4Square. Even if I disagree with him on that I think your post is out of line.ShagbarkWhat I find strange is how horrified all the women in the story are at the idea that the men around them might have some information about who they are and what theyre like.
If there was an app I could use to give out information to women around me about who I am and what Im like Id be all over it.
Does creepy mean anything that threatens womens monopoly on sexual information and power?Maki@Shagbark
It IS implicitly a bad thing for men to have information about who women are and what theyre like if it is WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.
If a guy wants to get to know a girl he should have the decency to ask.
The whole point of this article is that most people do not understand their privacy settings and how their ignorance facilitates people obtaining information on them without their even being aware of it.You may very well want to give out your personal information to everyone upon entering an establishment but you should also respect the rights of others to maintain a certain level of privacy.
As has been said in comments below it all boils down to the difference between opt-in and opt-out business models.
Having to opt-out of having ones information unknowingly given to strangers is creepy.
It has nothing to do with either sex having a monopoly on sexual information and power.
Whatever that even means.sabrina DStrange thing !!!synyxI still dont understand quite what is different about this vs. Assisted Serendipity  which also uses the Foursquare API to accomplish much the same effect.LAVINIAMONROEmy udys x-if mks $63  hour o th compute.

It was not blaming these women at all. It was just simply saying that people should be aware that apps like these can take public information on foursquare and Facebook and broadcast to anyone Including creepers.You are either trolling. Or you didnt read the article. Or you didnt comprehend it.
It was not blaming these women or saying they should be punished. Rather it was saying that online privacy should be protected more.There are creepers and deviants out there that will prey on people and we need to learn how defend ourselves.
Youre getting mad at a person for advocating the use of a rape whistle. Or a better analogy would be telling a kid. You know you probably shouldnt wear your name on your shirt and you shouldnt talk to strangers (I was told that as a kid in like every grade in elementary school). Its not blaming the child. Its simply a good tip to protect against creepers (who deserve all of the blame).I definitely think we should have programs that prevent rapists from becoming rapists.
But there are still rapists out there and we need to learn to protect ourselves.
And getting mad at people trying to give a heads up about information that could possibly be used to stalk people is counter productive.Again to reiterate just to make sure you understand. Its about protecting people. Not blaming them for the actions of deviants.Haley Gossett@David Neesleystfu! Ur a guy so u dont get it!

Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy
Netflixs $1 million contest for the best method to improve its movie recommendations was such a research and business hit that when the winners were declared last September the company immediately announced plans for another one.But it turned out that letting very smart computer scientists and statisticians dig through the video rental sites data had one major unforeseen drawback. A pair of researchers at the University of Texas showed that the supposedly anonymized data released for the contest which included movie recommendations and choices made by hundreds of thousands of customers could in fact be used to identify them.That brought the attention of the Federal Trade Commission and also drew a lawsuit from KamberLaw L.L.C. On Friday bowing to privacy concerns Netflix said it was shelving its plans for a sequel to the first contest.In a post on a company blog Neil Hunt Netflixs chief product officer explained that the company had reached an understanding with the F.T.C. and settled the lawsuit. The resolution of both matters involves certain parameters on how we use Netflix data in any future research programs he said.Netflix Mr. Hunt wrote will continue to explore ways to collaborate with the research community to improve its recommendation system.The three-year competition for the first Netflix Prize which began in 2006 offered $1 million to the first group that could improve the predictive accuracy of the companys movie recommendation software by at least 10 percent. A seven-person team led by two current and one former employee of AT&T; Labs won the contest.

Partners: phishing attack created privacy issue for 3300 patients
BOSTON (STATE HOUSE)  Workers at one of the states health care giants responded to phishing emails last year compromising their email accounts and potentially giving unauthorized users access to patient Social Security numbers and clinical information.
Partners HealthCare System on Thursday announced it is notifying about 3300 patients about a privacy incident stemming from information it learned about on Nov. 25 2014 concerning workers who responded to phishing emails which are used to obtain confidential information.
Partners said its own electronic medical records system was not compromised and it has no evidence that any patient information in the affected email accounts has been misused. The company is asking affected patients to review insurance benefit statements and to contact their insurers if they see services listed on statements that they didnt receive.
The announcement was made by Partners and its affiliates including Brigham and Womens Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital North Shore Medical Center Partners Continuing Care and Newton-Wellesley Hospital. Partners said that upon learning of the attack it secured the email accounts and contacted law enforcement officials while beginning an investigation working with computer forensic experts.
Some of the vulnerable email accounts contained patient names addresses dates of birth telephone numbers Social Security numbers and clinical information such as diagnoses treatment medical record numbers diagnosis codes and health insurance information.
To help prevent something like this from happening in the future Partners HealthCare has re-enforced workforce member education regarding phishing emails and is enhancing its existing technical safeguards to protect patient information the company said.

Education|Harvard Explains Why Staff E-Mails Were Searched
By RICHARD PREZ-PEA and JESS BIDGOODMARCH 11 2013
CAMBRIDGE Mass.  Harvard and its president on Monday made their first public comments on the universitys searching of staff members e-mail accounts and offered a qualified apology for keeping the searches secret from most of the employees involved.
The episode has angered faculty members and refocused attention on Harvards largest cheating scandal in memory which involved a take-home final exam in a government class last spring. After an investigation about 70 students were forced to take a leave of absence.In September when confidential information about cheating cases appeared in news reports administrators ordered searches of the e-mail accounts of 16 resident deans to find the source of the leaks.
Harvard E-Mail Search Stuns Faculty MembersMARCH 10 2013
In an online statement posted Monday morning university officials acknowledged the searches and explained their reasoning. The statement eased the concerns of some faculty members but did not alleviate them completely and professors said they expected that e-mail privacy would be the topic of a full-throated discussion at the next faculty meeting in early April.
Drew Gilpin Faust the president of Harvard University.
In her first comment on the matter Harvards president Drew Gilpin Faust said that she did not know about the searches at the time but that having been apprised I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned.Faculty responses revealed a gap between expectations in academia where privacy is often seen as integral to academic freedom and the corporate world in which employees are often told to assume that workplace e-mails are not private. Some professors wondered aloud whether they had been nave to think that things would be different at a university and said they were forced to re-examine assumptions about confidentiality.Its disturbing because I dont know what it means about whether they could look at my own e-mail said Oliver Hart an economics professor. We need to have a discussion and a better understanding of the policy.He and other professors said the searches would prompt him to conduct more business through private e-mail accounts outside of Harvards reach.Most professors who agreed to discuss the matter on Monday insisted on anonymity not wanting to run afoul of the administration. Several of them conceding that the university had a legal right to conduct the searches said the problem was as one put it that we never thought they would  we never thought about it at all and we probably should have.One leak last year involved an e-mail from the universitys Administrative Board to resident deans offering guidance on how to advise students accused of cheating. Some have questioned why such a minor breach prompted an investigation.But the statement posted Monday attributed to Michael D. Smith dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and Evelynn M. Hammonds dean of Harvard College said administrators were more troubled by another leak recounting closed-door discussions by the Administrative Board.
The disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information  especially student information we have a duty to protect as private  was at risk the deans wrote.Resident deans live among students in Harvards residential houses and act as student advisers and they are also lecturers meaning that they teach courses but are not on a tenure track to professorship. Each one generally has a personal Harvard e-mail account and one specifically for the job of resident dean.The deans statement on Monday emphasized that the search was conducted only of the resident dean accounts not personal ones and only for the subject line on each message to determine whether the confidential e-mail had been forwarded.The search determined that one resident dean had forwarded the e-mail to two students who were accused of cheating and had sought the deans advice.Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote that the resident dean who had forwarded the messages did so in good faith and was not punished. The statement did not say whether administrators determined how the e-mail found its way to the news media or who was responsible for the other leak of the Administrative Boards deliberations.That resident dean and one other were told about the e-mail searches shortly after they took place administrators said but the other 14 resident deans were not told until last week after The Boston Globe inquired about the matter.They were not told to protect the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote. We understand that others may see the situation differently and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient.On his blog Michael Mitzenmacher a computer science professor wrote that he was satisfied with some parts of the administrations explanation but in my opinion the administration made an error in judgment in not telling the resident deans of the search.Wilfried Schmid a mathematics professor said he still wanted to know more about what happened. I certainly get the sense that many of my colleagues will be upset and so there will be a discussion he said.But he urged the faculty not to lose sight of what he considered the bigger issue the cheating episode itself.
An article on Tuesday about Harvards explanation of why it searched staff members e-mail accounts misstated in some copies and at several points the surname of the dean of Harvard College. She is Evelynn M. Hammonds not Hammond.

White Hat Uses Foursquare Privacy Hole to Capture 875K Check-Ins
If you have checked in with Foursquare in San Francisco in the last three weeks Jesper Andersen probably knows where and when  even if youve set your check-ins to be published to friends only.
Andersen a coder who recently built a service called Avoidr that helps you avoid social network friends you dont really like figured out that Foursquare had a privacy leak because of how it published user check-ins on web pages for each location.
On pages like the one for San Franciscos Ferry Building Foursquare shows a random grid of 50 pictures of users who most-recently checked in at that location  no matter what their privacy settings. When a new check-in occurs the site includes that persons photo somewhere in the grid. So Andersen built a custom scraper that loaded the Foursquare web page for each location in San Francisco looked for the differences and logged the changes.
Even though he was using an old computer running through the slow but anonymous Tor network Andersen estimates he logged about 70 percent of all check-ins in San Francisco over the last three weeks.
Foursquare is one of the most popular of a growing number of services that let people quickly report to friends family or the entire world where they are  and is part of a growing trend of making public more information that used to be private. Foursquares popularity is tied to its game-like ecosystem where users can win badges for certain actions or become the mayor of locations by checking in there more than any other users.
Andersen reported the privacy breach to Foursquare two Sundays ago  and the company admitted the bug existed. They asked for a week or so to fix the bug and now according to an e-mail sent to Alexander the company is modifying its privacy settings to let users opt out of being listed on locations web pages. The site previously allowed users to opt out of being listed in the Whos here now function but until Tuesday that button didnt apply to listing Whos checked in there.
Im trying to be white-hat Andersen said. It definitely felt icky at times.
Andersen confirmed the validity of his scripts findings by checking the results with people he knew. And even though his groups of friends live in a data mining culture the findings didnt sit well with all of them.
Some were grossed out by it and a couple of people stopped using Foursquare Andersen said.
Foursquare declined to respond to two e-mail requests for comment but in an e-mail to Andersen Foursquare programmer Jon Hoffman thanked Alexander for bringing the issue to the companys attention.
The privacy leak on the venue page was something that was overlooked when we added privacy-protection features to the whos here now section of the venue page on the mobile clients (the data thats exposed via the API) Hoffman wrote Tuesday morning. There already is a privacy toggle on the /settings page to control privacy for that feature but it did not extend to the whos been here section of the venue page on the website.
Weve recently locked down the whos been here section so that it respects the Whos here privacy toggle.
While Jesper praised the company for its speed in handling the privacy leak report hes less enthusiastic about the solution.
Its not clear that users will really understand that Jesper said referring to the new check box. I certainly havent seen a drop-off in check-in collections.
By default Foursquare users are included in both the lists of who is currently at a location and who has visited it and the company did not tell its users Tuesday of the privacy leak or the changes.
Jesper acknowledges that breach isnt particularly useful for spying on any one person but thinks the data is useful in aggregate and that the company wasnt abiding by the privacy promises it had made.
That sentiment is echoed by Philip Flip Kromer who is the president of InfoChimps  a start-up that is making a market for people to buy and sell large datasets. For instance the company has mined billions of Tweets to create a dataset that presents a word cloud for each Twitter account letting people see how often a given Twitter user uses each word or lets companies find out who has been talking about them and what else they tend to talk about.
If you had access to the core Foursquare corpus including everyone who has checked in you would have a similarity network that you could use to build a Yelp-like service  that would be a Yelp that could tell vegetarians not to go to the best-rated restaurant in town because it is a steakhouse Kromer said.
In fact according to Kromer data sets like the one Andersen scraped are so full of meaning that you can simply use existing algorithms like the one Google uses to rank web pages or Amazon uses to make product recommendations and expose deep patterns.
But the breach should be viewed with perspective and an eye towards learning from the mistake according to Kromer.
Its a screw-up and the fix should now be adopted as best practice for all sites Kromer said.
This will be one of many but people should articulate a concrete threat scenario before getting angry.
For those more interested in stalking than amassing a giant dataset Alexander also found that Foursquares practice of awarding badges to users for certain check-ins can also be monitored in near real-time by constantly reloading a particular users page. That could let a determined tech-savvy stalker to find out exactly where someone is at a given time.
Foursquare admitted to Jesper it knows about this bug describing it as a known issue but has yet to come up with a fix.
Well continue to evaluate privacy concerns as we develop the product Hoffman wrote. We want to carefully balance user engagement with privacy.
UPDATE: On Wednesday at 5:40 PM Pacific time nine days after being notified of the privacy breach Foursquare published a notice to users about the leak.

pri_250_db,tracking cookie accidentally set by facebook; even.txt,"Facebook: Cookie tracking issue is limited fix coming today | ZDNet
This web site uses cookies to improve your experience. By viewing our content you are accepting the use of cookies. To find out more and change your cookie settings please view our cookie policy.
Facebook: Cookie tracking issue is limited fix coming today
Facebook has confirmed a tracking cookie bug and said it will fix it today. The company has also explained that the issue is limited in scope  only some third-party websites are affected.
Soon after self-proclaimed hacker Nik Cubrilovic discovered Facebook is once again setting its datr cookie via the Like button and other social plugins the company has made an attempt to clarify the findings. Facebook has confirmed this is indeed a bug but says that it is limited in scope and that it will be fixed today.
The cookie in question can be set even if the user has never been to Facebook and even if he or she doesn't click on a given Facebook widget. It can be read later to track a user across different Web properties and back to the Facebook site. Cubrilovic said it is reportedly the first cookie set on all third-party websites with a Facebook social plugin and for all users of the social network  whether you are logged in or logged out.
I contacted Facebook and a spokesperson pointed me to a comment made to Cubrilovic by Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik:
I am a engineer at Facebook who works on Facebook's login systems. Thanks for raising this issue. We still have a policy of not building profiles based on data from logged out users. Reports like this help us make sure we're adhering to that policy which has not changed. As we discussed last week we are examining our cookie setting behavior to make sure we do not inadvertently receive data that could be associated with a specific person not logged into Facebook.
We have been made aware of 2 instances in the past 2 weeks related to cookies which needed to be addressed. What you describe in this post is not a re-enabling of anything but a separate issue involving a limited number of sites including CBSSports. We have moved quickly to investigate and resolve this latest issue which will be fully addressed today. We encourage security researchers to test our practices and report them to us through our whitehat program which rewards people like you who identify issues.
I also asked for further clarification on how many third-party websites have this issue and why not all websites are affected. ""Sites that called our API in a non-standard way one in which we had not considered to protect against cookie-setting for non-users were impacted by this bug"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.
It looks like another mystery has been solved although something tells me this story is not over. Going forward Facebook is going to face much closer scrutiny related to its cookies and user tracking than it ever has before.
Part of this will come from legal bodies. 10 privacy groups and US congressmen last week sent letters asking the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate Facebook for these and other practices. Furthermore Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner has agreed to conduct a privacy audit of Facebook. Given that the social network's international headquarters is in Dublin the latter is the more serious one as the larger majority of the site's users could be affected. Facebook has even had to defend itself in regards to a recent patent it filed arguing that the document does not describe how to track logged-out users.

U.S.|U.S. Workers Are on Alert After Breach of Data
WASHINGTON  Federal workers at the General Services Administration are on alert against identity theft after an employee sent the names and Social Security numbers of the agencys entire staff to a private e-mail address.The agency which manages federal property employs more than 12000 people. Officials apologized to employees for the incident in a letter dated Oct. 25  almost six weeks after the breach occurred. The agency said it had paid for employees to enroll in a one-year program to monitor their credit reports along with up to $25000 in identity theft insurance coverage.The letter was signed by Casey Coleman the chief information officer and Gail Lovelace the agencys senior privacy official. Neither returned calls or e-mails for comment.Sara Merriam a spokeswoman for the agency said in a statement on Wednesday: Ensuring the security of employee data is no small challenge in large organizations. We will continue to evolve our protocols to protect the employee information entrusted to us.Documents show that officials first notified employees on Sept. 28. But workers who spoke with The New York Times said they did not learn of the incident until early November when the letters arrived in the mail. Previous notices had been sent as security alert e-mails which employees said they received frequently and often ignored.According to interviews and documents obtained by The Times technicians discovered the e-mail with names and Social Security numbers while reviewing logs on Sept. 22 a week after the message was sent and deleted it from the recipients e-mail account and laptop.The agency explained to employees that one worker had apparently transmitted the file containing the personal data by accident while seeking work-related assistance and that it had not been forwarded. Those involved had cooperated and the computer that received the data was scrubbed clean by agency technicians.Still Jack Hanley who presides over a council representing the roughly 4000 General Services employees who are members of the National Federation of Federal Employees union said the agencys delay in notifying employees had put them at greater risk. Additionally he said employees would remain vulnerable after the one-year period.Some of them have come to our office who have worked years to clean up their credit and have just got mortgages approved he said in an interview on Wednesday. And now if someone messes with their credit theyre going to lose.According to the documents the agency inspector general is investigating the incident. The inspector general Brian Miller did not return calls for comment.

U.S.|Old Mug Shots Fuel Art and a Debate on Privacy
CINCINNATI  People have long romanticized the 1950s  Marilyn Monroes windswept dress Sun rockabilly 45s beatnik coffeehouse gatherings Madison Avenue martini lunches.
But old forgotten mug shots? What is appealing about that?Two young women in Cincinnati are testing the fringes of Fabulous Fifties nostalgia by selling reproductions of 1955 police mug shots. And their company Larken Design has found such a good response here that it is expanding.I definitely think its the mystery says Tara Finke 28 one of the owners. I kind of feel like Im getting a glimpse of something Im not supposed to.But as the business grows it raises questions with no clear answers about the legality and propriety of distributing government property like mug shots which are increasingly popular enticements to Web sites like The Smoking Gun.Should there be privacy protection for the subjects as well as safeguards to the way public agencies dispose of potentially embarrassing hard copies of records in an age known for using digital technology to recycle found images into art? And even when it is not the intent does finding a new use for material like an old mug shot amount to profiting off someone elses ancient misfortune?
Larken Design in Cincinnati is selling artwork and notebooks with police mug shots from the 1950s raising concerns about the privacy rights of individuals and the disposal of public records.
Ms. Finke found the original photos nearly two years ago at an antiques store in Gardnerville Nev. They were thrown out more than a decade earlier by the Alameda County Sheriffs Department in California when it went to an automated jail-information system. The Nevada store owner had bought about 200 of them for $50 from an unknown local flea-market seller. Ms. Finke bought eight at a bit less than $5 each.This year she and a friend Megan Scherer decided to start their company to sell digitally retouched copies of the mug shots. Ms. Scherer 27 a magazine art director and Ms. Finke an architectural intern are graduates of the College of Design Architecture Art and Planning at the University of Cincinnati. They have apartments in the same building in the arts-friendly Northside neighborhood here and had been looking for a personal creative outlet.Ive always collected old photographs and wanted to blow them up Ms. Scherer said. I enjoy them because of their history  not that I can always find out that history. The fact they already belonged to someone else makes it more meaningful than if they were new.But who owns that history? There are ongoing questions about the privacy of people listed in court records says Jason Schultz a director of the Samuelson Law Technology and Public Policy Clinic at the law school of the University of California Berkeley. We think Wow its in the public record but in reality if its in a file somewhere that you cant Google it remains private until we need it. Now that records are becoming more public I think courts are trying to think about how to be sensitive to those interests given that they can be indexed by search engines copied and reposted.
Larken Designs images show the subjects  two men two women  in classic booking-shot poses. In one pose they look forward while a small board spells out Cincinnati Police Department. (The real mug shots say Alameda.) The photos which have also been touched up to highlight physical features do not reveal anyones name although Ms. Finke and Ms. Scherer have that information for three of their four subjects.Since this product made its debut (and sold out) at a local crafts fair in March Ms. Larken has sold about 100 prints posters and notebooks in black and white and in color for prices ranging from $10 to $15 each. Larken Design is about to expand into tote bags and a larger poster size. International orders are arriving through notices on the crafts Web site Etsy and the two women will venture for the first time in September to Chicagos large Renegade Craft Fair.This reappearance of these old mug shots surprises Casey Nice assistant sheriff for Alameda County which includes Oakland Berkeley and Alameda. Around 15 to 25 years ago someone decided to throw out old mug shots and somehow they wound up outside the department.We can talk about the wisdom of throwing it in the trash rather than just destroying them Sheriff Nice said but it was what it was.Sheriff Nice says that since arrest records in California are public information dissemination does not appear to be a crime. Nor for that matter he adds did they have copyright protection.But if any of the subjects should re-emerge could they threaten to sue over privacy violation? Opinions are mixed but one law professor said he believed there would be a strong defense.In terms of public revelation of private fact they can say theyre not telling the names of anybody so theyre not harming any individual and that under the First Amendment theyre allowed to publish truthful old photos said Peter Swire a law and judicial administration professor at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. The fact theyre making money doesnt change the analysis.

Dr. Fernando Rojas looked at waitresses' medical records
Privacy commissioner urges disciplinary action against doctor
Hospital privacy breach 'unprecedented' regulatory body says
Health department won't remove doctor for privacy breach
An investigation by the province's privacy commissioner found Dr. Fernando Rojas had accessed the personal health records of dozens of female patients without authorization over a 28-month period.
Vitalit Health Network is asking Codiac Regional RCMP in Moncton to investigate possible criminal charges after one of its doctors accessed the electronic medical records of dozens of female patients without authorization.
An investigation by New Brunswick's Privacy Commissioner Anne Bertrand determined Dr. Fernando Rojas Lievano a radiation oncologist atthe Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton had accessed the personal health information of 141 females between the ages of 13 and 39 without authorization.
Bertrand's investigation found Rojas had accessed the files during a 28-month period dating back to September 2010. Bertrand made a series of recommendations to Vitalit Health Authority.
Vitalitshould consider disciplinary measures againstRojas
Vitalitshould consider charges under the Provincial Offences Procedures Act
Random audits of access to electronic patient records be made more frequent
The authority quickly limit or restrict access to patient records when any suspicious activities are found
Continue the limits on Rojass access to the electronic patient records system and impose ongoing monitoring
Vitalit's board of directors announced Tuesday it had passed a motion accepting Bertrand's recommendations and said it would immediately refer the matter to the RCMP for investigation.
Vitalit CEORinoVolpsays the health network is taking the case seriously.
It has been reviewing the privacy breach since February 2013.
""According to the commissioner and according to the board and to us it's major you know when somebody does access without permission"" Volp said.
""It's a major breach of trust you know. This is what was recommended and this is why we're going in this direction.""
In the privacy commissioner's report Rojas apologized for what he did.
He told hospital officials he looked at the files out of interest and to find out how old the patients were.
Rojas has not been working since February and remains on leave from the hospital.
""It's for medical reasons. It's a leave of absence"" said Volp. ""But still his status is legal status with the heath authority until that internal process is over and some recommendations are made"" he said.

FTC Sues Failed Website Toysmart.com for Deceptively Offering for Sale Personal Information of Website Visitors
The Federal Trade Commission today filed a complaint against Toysmart.com LLC and Toysmart.com Inc. a failed Internet retailer of children's toys in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the sale of confidential personal customer information collected on the company Web site in violation of its own privacy policy. The complaint alleges that Toysmart a Delaware company located in Waltham Massachusetts that is now in bankruptcy has violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by misrepresenting to consumers that personal information would never be shared with third parties and then disclosing selling or offering that information for sale.""Even failing dot-coms must abide by their promise to protect the privacy rights of their customers"" said Chairman Robert Pitofsky. ""The FTC seeks to ensure these promises are kept.""Through its Web site Toysmart collects detailed personal information about its visitors including name address billing information shopping preferences and family profiles which include the names and birthdates of children. Since September 1999 Toysmart has posted a privacy policy which states that information collected from customers will never be shared with third parties.That policy states that:Personal information voluntarily submitted by visitors to our site such as name address billing information and shopping preferences is never shared with a third party.The policy continues:When you register with toysmart.com you can rest assured that your information will never be shared with a third party.Toysmart announced on May 22 2000 that it was closing its operations and selling its assets. Soon thereafter the FTC learned about Toysmart's possible violation of its own privacy policy from TRUSTe a non-profit privacy seal organization that had licensed Toysmart to display its seal. FTC staff investigated this information and discovered that Toysmart was offering its customer list for sale in violation of its own privacy policy.Toysmart's creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts Eastern Division on June 9 2000; Toysmart filed its assent to the bankruptcy petition on June 23 2000. In light of the company's bankruptcy case FTC staff may file a notice of appearance and a notice of pending action in the Bankruptcy Court.The Commission vote to authorize staff to file the complaint was 5-0.NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has ""reason to believe"" that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law. The case will be decided by the court.Copies of the complaint are available from the FTC's Consumer Response Center Room 130 600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. Washington D.C. 20580; 877-FTC-HELP (877-382-4357); TDD for the hearing impaired 1-866-653-4261.

Personal Tech|Price of Facebook Privacy? Start Clicking
Pop quiz: Which is longer the United States Constitution or Facebooks Privacy Policy?If you guessed the latter youre right. Facebooks Privacy Policy is 5830 words long; the
United States Constitution without any of its amendments is a concise 4543 words.Facebook one of the most popular social networks in the world has more than 400 million
registered people on its Web site. Half of these users log in to the service every day the company says and users spend 500 billion minutes on the site each month.But in recent months Facebook has revised its privacy policy to require users to opt out if they wish to keep information private making most of that information public by default.
Some personal data is now being shared with third-party Web sites.
Facebook Privacy: A Bewildering Tangle of OptionsMAY 12 2010
As a result the company has come under a blitz from privacy groups government officials and its own users who complain that the new policy is bewildering and the new opt-out settings too time-consuming to figure out and use.There are always trade-offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt said Elliot Schrage vice president for public policy at Facebook. We have tried to offer the most comprehensive and detailed controls and comprehensive and detailed information about them.The new opt-out settings certainly are complex. Facebook users who hope to make their personal information private should be prepared to spend a lot of time pressing a lot of buttons. To opt out of full disclosure of most information it is necessary to click through more than 50
privacy buttons which then require choosing among a total of more than 170 options.Users must decide if they want only friends friends of friends everyone on Facebook or a customized list of people to see things like their birthdays or their most recent photos. To keep information as private as possible users must select only friends or only me from the pull-down options for all the choices in the privacy settings and must uncheck boxes that say information will be shared across the Web.Facebooks Help Center is available to assist users but the word count for the privacy-related FAQ adds up to more than 45000 words.Even if a user changes all the settings on the privacy section of the site certain pieces of information will still be shared across the site unless a user takes further action. For example under the Account Settings option in the Facebook Ads tab two options are automatically turned on to share some information with advertising networks and friends. Anyone who wants to keep this information private must uncheck the boxes in that tab.And still some information will no longer remain private because Facebook has also added a feature called community pages which automatically links personal data like hometown or university to topic pages for that town or university. The only way to disappear from those topic pages is to delete
A chart on May 13 with an article in the Personal Tech pages about Facebooks privacy settings labeled one setting incorrectly. The setting labeled The Like Button actually controls the sites Instant Personalization feature. The description also referred incorrectly to the function of the Instant Personalization feature. It personalizes Web sites based in part on your friends activity on those sites; it does not use your friends browsing habits. And the description erroneously listed a company among Facebook partners using the feature. Yelp and Pandora use the feature to personalize their Web sites; CNN does not.

Last year we introduced online interest-based advertising  ads based on people's use of other websites and apps  that helps solve this problem. For example with online interest-based ads if you visit hotel and airline websites to research an upcoming trip you might then see ads for travel deals on Facebook.We let everyone know about this new type of advertising last year and we've been gradually introducing it around the world.
We also offered people tools to turn off these ads including the Digital Advertising Alliance AdChoices program which provides a mechanism that allows you to opt out across more than 100 companies. Additional tools are provided in the advertising controls on iOS and Android devices.Today we're introducing an additional way for people to turn off this kind of advertising from the ad settings page right on Facebook.

Italian Magazine Publishes Disputed Images of Duchess
By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and ALAN COWELLSEPT. 17 2012
ROME  Chi a glossy Italian gossip magazine on Monday became the latest outlet to publish images of the Duchess of Cambridge the former Kate Middleton sunbathing topless while on vacation in France.
The magazine is owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis Mondadori group which also publishes Closer a French magazine that was the first to come out with photographs of the duchess and her husband Prince William on a terrace next to a swimming pool at a secluded villa in Provence.The British royal family incensed by what it calls an invasion of its privacy was preparing to pursue legal action in France later on Monday against the unidentified person who took the photographs.A spokesman for the couple said The complaint concerns the taking of photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge whilst on holiday and the publication of those photographs in breach of their privacy.
British Royals to File Complaint Over Topless PhotosSEPT. 16 2012
The royal household has compared the clandestine photography of the duchess with the paparazzi pursuit of Prince Williams mother Diana Princess of Wales who died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997.In Italy Chi offered readers a lavish spread of images on Monday its cover depicting a somewhat fuzzy photograph of the duchess with a boldface headline: The Queen Is Naked.Some Italians said they saw a certain irony in Mr. Berlusconis ownership of Closer and Chi since the former prime minister has made scandalous headlines of his own for dalliances with scantily clad and sometimes under-age women.Italian columnists lost no time in criticizing Mr. Berlusconi who has been pondering a return to the political stage after resigning last November as the euro zone crisis pushed Italys economy to the edge of a financial precipice.On Sunday an article in the Rome daily La Repubblica which has been one of Mr. Berlusconis fiercest critics accused the former prime minister of betraying an allied country by permitting the publication of the photos despite requests from Buckingham Palace not to do so.This is the triumphal outcome of the famous conflict of interests the columnist Francesco Merlo wrote in the newspaper musing that the publication of the photographs would permit Queen Elizabeth II  Prince Williams grandmother  to permanently eliminate Mr. Berlusconi from her list of accredited statesmen and gentlemen.No Western ambassador will ever shake his hand again Mr. Merlo predicted. Berlusconi does not understand that a gossipmonger is not compatible with a statesman.On Monday Marina Berlusconi the daughter of Mr. Berlusconi and the chairwoman of Mondadori lashed out at the attack defending both the magazine and her father.Mondadori she wrote in a letter published in La Repubblica is a publishing house that uses in the best way possible the freedom and independence that shareholders have always bestowed on it and even in this case it just did its job noting that dozens of magazines had vied for the photos.
Her father she wrote deals with politics and with all respect has other things to think about rather than a photo spread.The magazine hit newsstands Monday and one downtown vendor said that while early sales had been sluggish she expected them to pick up. Certainly theres been such a buzz around these photos for days the vendor Rossana Farina said.The British royal family began legal proceedings against Closer magazine last week calling the photographs a grotesque abuse.No British outlet has published the photographs respecting an informal agreement between the press and the royal family at a time when journalists behavior and practices are under scrutiny after the phone hacking scandal swirling mainly around tabloids owned by Rupert Murdoch.But The Irish Daily Star carried the images on Saturday eliciting further expressions of annoyance from the duke and duchess who are currently on a far-flung tour in connection with Queen Elizabeth IIs diamond jubilee celebration. The Italian publication of the pictures coincided with the royal couples visit to the Solomon Islands.Britains Press Association quoted Alfonso Signorini the editor of Chi as saying the photographs represented a deserving topic because it shows in a completely natural way the daily life of a very famous young and modern couple in love.
Elisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome and Alan Cowell from London.

pri_250_db,"46m records compromised at tjmaxx, homegoods, mars.txt","You probably heard about the Target data breach that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of the retail giant's customers into the hands of cybercriminals in late 2013. But Target's security nightmare wasn't the worst data breach in history.
Here are the 10 worst data breaches in history  so far.
Heartland Payment Systems 2008-2009: 130 million records compromised
In early 2009 this Princeton New Jersey-based payment processor announced the largest data breach ever to affect an American company. Heartland's breach exposed information from approximately 130 million credit and debit cards to cybercriminals.
Malware planted on Heartland's network recorded card data as it arrived from retailers. Because the company processed payments for more than 250000 businesses across the country the impact was huge.
In 2010 Albert Gonzalez the convicted mastermind behind the Heartland breach (as well as another huge breach) was sentenced to 20 years in prison  the longest sentence ever handed down for computer crime in a U.S. court.
Target Stores 2013: 110 million records compromised
In December 2013 retail giant Target confirmed that hackers had infected the company's payment-card readers making off with approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers that had been used at Target stores in the United States during the 2013 post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.
In January 2014 Target announced that the contact information  full names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers  of 70 million customers had also been compromised. Some of those customers probably also had credit-card data compromised in the earlier breach but it's possible that as many as 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Sony online entertainment services 2011: 102 million records compromised
In April 2011 attackers whose identities are still unknown targeted the PlayStation Network that links Sony's home gaming consoles as well as Sony Online Entertainment which hosts massively multiplayer online PC games and the Qriocity video- and music-streaming service.
Initially Sony said that only the personal information of 78 million PlayStation Network users  login credentials names addresses phone numbers and email addresses  had been exposed. But the tally of compromised accounts rose by 24.6 million when investigators discovered the attackers had also penetrated SOE and Qriocity. The credit-card data of approximately 23400 SOE users in Europe was also stolen.
Following the initial breach disclosure the PlayStation Network went dark worldwide for more than three weeks. In May 2011 Sony estimated its cleanup costs  which included fighting 65 class-action lawsuits brought against the company  at $171 million.
National Archive and Records Administration 2008: 76 million records compromised
Not all data breaches are the result of criminal activity. In late 2008 a hard drive at the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) stopped working. It held the names contact information and Social Security numbers of 76 million U.S. military veterans.
Instead of being destroyed on-site the drive was sent for repair to a government contractor which determined the drive could not be fixed  so it was sent it out to be scrapped. It is not clear whether the drive was actually destroyed.
Following complaints by an IT manager at NARA an investigation was launched and NARA changed its policies to destroy all malfunctioning storage media containing sensitive personal information.
""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII [personally identifiable information] occurred and therefore does not believe that notification [of the affected veterans] is necessary or appropriate at this time"" the agency told Wired News in 2009.
Anthem 2015: 69 million to 80 million records compromisedIn February 2015 Anthem formerly known as WellPoint and the second-largest health insurer in the U.S. revealed its customer database had been breached. Stolen data included names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers and employment histories  everything an identity thief might need. As many as 80 million current and former customers were thought to be affected.
Epsilon 2011: 60 million to 250 million records compromised
In March 2011 the Texas-based marketing firm Epsilon which handled email communications for more than 2500 clients worldwide  including seven Fortune 10 companies  announced that databases pertaining to about 50 Epsilon clients had been stolen.
Email addresses of at least 60 million customers ended up in the hands of cybercriminals and more than a dozen major retailers banks hotels and other companies were affected including Best Buy JPMorgan Chase Capital One Bank and Verizon.
Epsilon could not confirm exactly how many individuals were affected. Conservative estimates put the number of email addresses stolen at 60 million but according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a San Diego-based nonprofit advocacy group the number may have been as high as 250 million.
Home Depot 2014: 56 million payment cards compromised
In September 2014 hardware and building-supplies warehouse retailer Home Depot admitted what had been suspected for weeks. Beginning in April or May of the same year ""carders"" had infected its point-of-sale systems at stores in the U.S. and Canada with malware that pretended to be antivirus software but instead stole customer credit and debit cards.
The theft may have been the largest haul of payment cards resulting from a direct attack on a retailer if the lower estimate from the TJX breach (see below) is accepted. But unlike the Target theft less than a year earlier the Home Depot theft didn't result in customers staying away nor did it generate quite the same media outcry.
Evernote 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In March 2013 users of the note-taking and archiving service Evernote learned that their email addresses usernames and encrypted passwords had been exposed by a security breach. No financial data was stolen and the company confirmed that none of the user-generated content on its servers had been compromised.
However as had been the case for those affected by Epsilon's 2011 breach Evernote users who had their usernames and email addresses stolen were vulnerable to spam emails and phishing campaigns  some of which pretended to be password-reset emails coming from Evernote itself.
Living Social 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In April 2013 Living Social a daily-deals site partly owned by Amazon announced that the names email addresses birth dates and encrypted passwords of more than 50 million customers worldwide had been stolen by hackers. Twenty million Living Social customers whose information was stored on servers in Asia were not affected.
TJX Companies Inc. 2006-2007: At least 46 million records compromised
When it was discovered in 2007 the TJX data breach was the biggest theft of consumer data ever in the United States affecting the parent company of several major retail brands including Marshalls T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. At least 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period but some estimates put the number at closer to 90 million.
About 450000 TJX customers also had their personally identifiable information stolen including driver's license numbers. The breach ultimately cost the Framingham Massachusetts-based company $256 million.
The TJX hackers included Albert Gonzalez who was cooperating with law-enforcement investigations into earlier data thefts when he took part in both the TJX breach and the even larger Heartland Payment Systems attack two years later.
Honorable mention: Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014: Company's inner workings completely exposed
On Nov. 24 2014 staffers at Sony Pictures Entertainment the movie and television production division of Sony had their computer screens hijacked by a grinning skull. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace said it had taken over the corporate network and would release detailed company information online if unspecified demands weren't met. Within days gigabytes of internal Sony Pictures data appeared on file-sharing sites including Social Security numbers and scanned passports belonging to actors and executives internal passwords unpublished scripts marketing plans financial and legal information and even four entire unreleased Sony movies.
The company's 6800 employees plus an estimated 40000 other individuals the company had paid over previous years were placed at dire risk of identity theft and rival Hollywood studios got a detailed blueprint of Sony Pictures' accounts future plans and internal workings.Some rumors blamed North Korea others disgruntled insiders. Whatever the cause the incident threatened the very survival of Sony Pictures Entertainment as a company and may be the most damaging corporate data breach ever.

In Fighting Crime How Wide Should a Genetic Net Reach?
ITS the latest criminal investigation technique and it gives new meaning to that old saw the ties that bind.
Recently forensic scientists in California used a genetic analysis procedure called familial searching or kinship searching to help the police identify a suspect in the Grim Sleeper serial murder case  and they did so by using a DNA sample collected for another purpose from the suspects own son. The Los Angeles police later arrested the father Lonnie David Franklin Jr. who has since been charged with 10 counts of murder.Forensic scientists routinely use a standard search method to try to identify a suspect who has left bits of DNA at a crime scene. They use a computer analysis to compare DNA from the
scene to DNA profiles of known convicted offenders stored in a state database. When the profiles match exactly genetic analysts call it a cold hit.But the Grim Sleeper case (so named because of an apparent hiatus in a killing spree that dates back to 1985) is unusual because after regular searches came up empty officials at Californias Bureau of Forensic Services decided to use familial searching a more controversial technique.The procedure involved widening the genetic net to include convicted felons whom they knew had not committed the murders but whose DNA profiles were partial matches to the suspect  similar enough to the suspects that they might be related to him.Lo and behold Mr. Franklins son had recently been convicted on a felony weapons charge and his DNA offered a partial match to crime-scene DNA. And for the first time in California that kind of one-degree-of-separation search ultimately led to an arrest.Although Britain has been using the technique for years familial searching in the United States is the Botox of criminal investigation. Early-adopter states like California and Colorado have tried it like it and plan where appropriate to use it again. The wait-and-see states are holding out while they consider the potential side effects and longer-term social ramifications.
Some critics have contended that the technique might lead to an abuse of the system or over time to the disproportionate arrest of African-American males because they have a higher
incarceration rate than men in other ethnic groups.But the immediate concern is that kinship searches could produce a long list of convicted felons who are only partial matches to an unidentified suspect. The risk is that the police while looking for a suspects family members might intrude on people who have not committed a crime. Some lawyers call it guilt by genetic association.Our concern is that the initial comparison that generates a list of partial matches does not narrow it down to a single suspects likely family member says Peter Bibring a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in Southern California. Its a list and at that point the invasion of privacy depends on how the police go about their business.
In the early 2000s the Forensic Science Service a company now owned by the British government that provides forensic analyses to police forces pioneered familial search methods for use in crime solving.The search method has helped solve infamous cold cases in England including that of the so-called Shoe Rapist named for a man who collected high heels from his victims. But the British have also used techniques that for some may raise concerns about privacy invasion.In the United States for example familial searches have used state databases that contain DNA profiles of convicted offenders. But in Britain the national database collects DNA profiles of convicted felons people who have been arrested but not convicted of a crime and people who have been arrested but not charged  subjecting a wider swath of the population to genetic surveillance.Familial searches in Britain also often require a lot of bricks-and-mortar police work. Forensic scientists generate a list of people who are partial DNA matches to a suspect. But then they give the list to local constables who may investigate and interview family members.Its very much soft intelligence said Cathy Turner the lead consultant of cold-case reviews at the Forensic Science Service. Its like having an informant and the police investigate the informants information.Would Americans stand for kinship searches if the police were given free rein to knock on the doors of people on a partial DNA match list many of whom may not have anything to do with the unsolved crime?I think here wed be a little more concerned with privacy said Frederick R Bieber a medical geneticist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston.California under its attorney general Jerry Brown has developed a precise set of guidelines that limit the use of familial searching. A committee made up of forensic and legal experts must meet at each stage of the process to discuss the latest findings and decide whether the search should continue to the next step.The familial search in the Grim Sleeper case began at a lab of the states Bureau of Forensic Services
in Richmond Calif. where forensic scientists came up with a list of 200 partial DNA matches from a database that contains 1.3 million profiles.To narrow down their list of 200 they analyzed the Y chromosome the male sex-determining chromosome that is passed from father to son. One person a man who had recently been convicted on a felony weapons charge was an exact match to the Y chromosome of crime-scene DNA. Next using corroborating information like birth certificates and Google mapping researchers figured out that the matching persons father would be a viable suspect.Now the committee had to vote on whether to give that name to police detectives.We would all discuss Are we going to hand over that name? said Jill Spriggs chief of the Bureau of Forensic Services. In the Grim Sleeper case we all voted to hand it over.WITH this one case California has become the model in the United States for how to conduct a kinship search. But the model is based on
guidelines not laws.Some advocates have suggested that each state enact its own regulations governing these kinship procedures. But the advent of familial searches raises important questions that may be better answered with a more sweeping authority: national mandatory standards governing the method and appropriate use of the technique.

pri_250_db,"adblock plus, an ad-blocking app, removed from the.txt","Adblock Plus and (a little) more: Adblock Plus for Android removed from Google Play store
Adblock Plus for Android removed from Google Playstore  2013-03-14 09:37 by Wladimir Palant
In a rather surprising move Google removed Adblock Plus and other ad blocking apps from the Google Play store due to interference with another service or product in an unauthorized manner. This looks like a course change at Google until recently the main distinction between Android and iPhone was that Android allowed you to install any app as long as it wasnt malicious (meaning that its obvious what the app does). Google Play still allows apps stating for rooted phones only but I wonder whether these are next on the list to be removed  each of them performs unauthorized actions.
Update (2013-03-16): The Electronic Frontier Foundation did a great job explaining why this move is sadly disappointing way better than I did.
Users who already have Adblock Plus installed will be able to continue using it. However they will no longer get updates which means that they should install our next release from our website once it is out.
Installing Adblock Plus from our website will still be possible. We will also add Adblock Plus to all alternative app stores to make sure its easier to find. The next release will also have automatic updates that are independent from the Google Play store (not quite as comfortable unfortunately) so updating manually will no longer be necessary.
We need to finalize some changes we were working on (in particular improving manual proxy configuration) and enable automatic updates (previously these were only necessary for development builds). We are also in the process of getting translations for our Android app. The release should be ready on Tuesday March 19th. If you arent that patient you can also try our development builds.
It seems illegal to me you should try to sue them
No it isnt illegal. Its their site  they are free to set the rules there. However this makes their commitment to open platforms look much less convincing. And: no open platform doesnt mean that anybody is free to just through some hoops to get non-approved software installed nevertheless. Google made the Play store very prominent in the OS keeping it open is central to keeping the platform open then.
dont worry well install update it ourself. people aware enough to block ads are smart enough to install it by themselves.
until recently the main distinction between Android and iPhone was that Android allowed you to install any app
Adblock is removed only from google play(due to violating their t&c) which is one of the many app stores.You can still install abp on android.
Sure you can it will require a number of additional steps however (like allowing installation from untrusted sources  something thats normally not recommended). In a way you can also install any app on iPhone  after rooting it.
so google say its interference with another service or product in an unauthorized manner. is that not exactly what they themselves are doing ?
Its about them potentially advertising revenue nothing else.
if Google remains committed such cruel intentions and force us to use or do not want to see what we will gradually abandoning their services are not the only ones!
si google sigue empeado en tan crueles intenciones y obligarnos a usar o ver lo que no queremos poco a poco iremos desistiendo de sus servicios no son los unicos!!!
Fuck you google engineers what did you do to freedom?
I use Google products and participate willfully in their data mining because they offer a useful service in exchange for it.
Its why I love it when they do stuff like push for open standards and offer easily hackable software/hardware.
But whenever they clampdown it undermines the goodwill and trust that is extremely hard to gain.
Would you trust Apple or Microsoft with all your data and closely guarded thoughts?
A work around install firefox browser and the adblock edge addon.
This is perfectly acceptable for Google to do this. Your product hinders Googles ability to make money. In return they have hindered yours. Its quite ironic. I just thought I would mention that as some fucking jackass above threw out the American Way comment (that makes our country look like a piece of shit) saying You should sue them!. I think a lot of people like your product I think that you should stay humble and find a way to deliver your product to your customers without causing legal dispute. One person at a time we can rebuild the reputation of our nation.
Its rarely the engineers who decide about actions as important as this one. Most probably some high-level manager convinced the upper management that banning adblockers from the Play Store will increase their revenue. She/he couldnt be further away from the truth.
Forcing ads on people who went the extra mile (i.e. looking up adblocker apps diving into the topic rooting the phone if necessary etc.) to avoid them will only result in annoyance and anger. How will that affect Googles income? :-)
Google is a brand. And if somebody is annoyed by thinking about it/them she/he will not prefer Googles services when it comes to a choice. And thats where they make their money. Obviously somebody didnt get it when she/he went to management/sales training. :-(
First they kill Reader now they remove Adblock Plus from the store.
Wow Google is pissing lots of people off this week. Ive spent sometime looking for my Google Reader replacement in which Ill be spending hours
Ive been a Google advocate for years no longer. Too many negatives over the last year or so to ignore.
Privacy issues along with the HARD PUSH for inclusion into G+ has me sorely disappointed.
Do try to remember some of the positives of Google but this does seem somewhat overbearing.
You should see if you made any recent changes that interfere with Googles advertising. Im sure they have something in the Google Play Store policy agreement that states if you interfere with their business directly then they can remove your app.
Hopefully it is that and you can either decide to revert the changes or not.
I would be surprised to find that they were pressured by 3rd party app developers Google usually isnt one to do that. (Or to do this without good reason for that matter.)
To Charley Hinton (Systems Engineer): nowhere in the comments above do I see anything about the American Way. So it is you who is a fucking jackass.
Now to the matter at hand. No it is not acceptable for google to remove a useful product such as this from the marketplace. Adblock is simply a block list and it is perfectly acceptable for me to control what is allowed in and out of my phone. Or are you one of those people who believes that that the phone is not actually mine but rather googles? In that case enjoy the ads/spam/crapware on your err i mean googles phone.
Thats it. This past week is the final nail in the coffin for me. Im pulling all my RSS feeds and telling everyone not to use my gmail account which Ill never use again. Ive had it with GoOgle.
And to the anon above who questioned whether anyone should trust Apple with their data the answer is simple. Google gets paid by third parties to share your data. People pay Apple to protect their data and NOT share it.
This is where you block google advertisements for being harsh enough to remove adblock.
Wow thats a tipping point for me where Ill stop to see Google as less evil than Apple.
Google has changed as any too big company where money has become more important than moral values.
Support Firefox and lets hope the best for FirefoxOS and co.
@Johannes: ALL companies are evil  Apple Google Microsoft Dell HP Cisco you just pick the one that bites you the least or bites you in a way that you dont mind.
If you want ethics and integrity thats what Open Source is there for: grab some hardware and make it yourself.
Guys this is actually a really good thing. Sites make their money from advertisements. A lot of the sites you go to wouldnt be able to run without donations or even worse forced subscriptions.
So long as adblock isnt known to everybody then sites wont have to resort to that. Some sites have annoying popup or flash advertisements while other sites have images in the side that do no harm.
And as for the Dont be evil thing of course Google sells your data and uses advertisements. How do you think the search engine runs? How do you think it has always run? They need money. Theyve always needed money. By selling how many people searched for x and giving advertisements related to x they can stay up without forcing subscriptions.
God damn! If Ive installed AdBlock than Ive OBVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED it to interfere with another service or product on MY device and on MY internet channel. wtf?
One of the main issues that Ive personally ran into was that after updating Chrome on the Nexus 4 ADP caused websites to show up blank (white). Only after uninstalling ADP and rebooting would content be displayed in the updated Chrome browser.
Thats a WebKit bug that we worked around already  feel free to install the next release.
I hadnt considered installing ABP for Android until Google made this big stink about it and I caught wind!
Jesus people its not illegal. They have a clause in the code of conduct about ad blocking theyre just choosing to enforce it now. Adaway and others are all gone under the same clause.
Tjk you seem to be saying that it is not evil because it is done for profit.
Well well well what next  avg and other AV software picking up ad blockers and quarantining them for being malicious code? Thats basically what google is doing here. Taking a service that you want and refusing it to you because it might hinder their profits.
Block all google related ad sense. Block it all and then try to use the net  they have their fingers in every damn pie. But its worth it to find out just how much freedom you still have while you have it. Very little. Id break this chain of profit slavery before it really fucks the net up. FU GOOGLE.
Ive always banned Google ADs and scripts long before started using AdBlock+. The HOSTS file or black list on your router are perfect places for this.
SO F*CK YOU GOOGLE. F*CK EVERY ADS MOTHERF*CKERS. GTFO FROM MY INTERNET. IT WAS A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT MONEY-SUCKING B*TCHES LIKE YOU SCROOGLE.
My company builds an ebook reader app that downloads an ebook from our site.
Ad Block plus on a phone was causing book downloads to fail.
And it took us (and the user) a long time to find this problem.
So while Google has their own revenue in mind I want to call out that Ad Block plus can affect other apps adversely.
Welcome to the post-PC era that everyone is trying to sell you!
This is removing users control over the web pages in their browsers.
It seems that Google want to increase views to their AdSense and AdWords. But this is absolutely unethical.
When I noticed it was no longer in the Google Play Store I wasnt surprised.
It constantly interferes with other apps and often completely blocks internet traffic on my phone.
I see above that the Dev states this may have already been fixed but I am running the newest version downloaded from this site and still having this issue.
Other than that I really hate Google for doing this.
Something fishy is going on over at Google. I dont like this. Really dont like this. And since this is beginning to happen who knows wholl follow.
Would it be an exaggerated counter-attack to stop providing ABP on Google Chrome so that Google would loose some market share in favour of Firefox ?
You know Google really confuses me sometimes really_
Will the new update (19th March) address the issue with Adblock plus incurring high data usage (Nexus 7). Yesterday Adblock plus downloaded a phanthom 1.5Gb data over my 3G connection which  if I didnt have alerts set I would have been charged a fortune by my provider. I love the App but if this cant be resolved Ill have to uninstall it.
So far its an issue we havent been able to reproduce here  despite several attempts.
What application(s) where you using during this period or what sites have you visited that could cause such traffic consumption? Can you guess?
So after the enforced installation of google plus on my phone now this. Google might be overplaing its hand here.
The enforcement of their rules on an open platform and paid-for phone/tablet are getting out of hand. Their must be a point where users are leaving ..
Problem is that ads sometimes add up to the bandwith big time hey Google if you want to pay for our bandwith wasted by ads then I am cool with this oh wait I bet you dont wanna pay for the bandwith u make me waste with ads right? Tough luck cya Google nice knowing ya.
Would you be willing to let people like myself mirror host the .apk for adblock on your site for Android other mobile OS down the line?
I mean I cannot install VLC either in my country from the official play store the birthplace of Gooooooooogle but I was able to grab it from a mirror.
Also would you be opposed to an official torrent of the .apk?
Your platform hinders Googles ability to monetize advertising on their platform.
Its no surprise they kill your app from their market.
This has nothing to do with keeping an open platform. You begin jeopardizing openness when you offer a product that cuts into the platforms bottom line.
A hindered means to monetize their ad network means theyre going to have to find another way to make money within the ecosystem.
Some ads are dumb but it doesnt change the fact that the internet we know now will morph into something much worse.
The people complaining about bandwidth need to take it up with their service provider.
Its rather entertaining to think about how pissed people are over this.
Its on par with people bitching that their neighbor had their internet service cut because they were caught stealing leeching their connection by some illegal means.
Adblocks already destroying the internet for PC users and now is trying to destroy the internet for mobile users.
Ads are the only thing that make the internet work taking down ads means breaking the internet.
This just proves that Google doesnt care about community anymore. The only thing theyre interested in are their advertisers the two of them are making a ton of cash while we need to stay calm and watch how our adsense earnings are getting lower and our apps getting banned. Well thats not fair at all.
Can you tell us if your Ad Blocker was first to block google ads? Have you happen to block goog analytics as well?
Id like to know if you achieved anything different to piss Google this much. If so Id like to learn what are they?
Frankly Ill be pleased if I can somehow limit Googles background ability on my Android phone. I already gave them lots of data: Contacts Emails and even Bookmarks. But Im sure they are actively monitoring my location activities and app usage statistics.
If you manage to block some of these data sources Id like to know and spread the word.
Thanks for the update! Up until now i coud not use the this extension in my phones browser.
I dont trust third party apk mirrors unless there is a developer provided hash I can check. It is far too easy to monkey with an apk. It is just a zip file of a jar.
Im glad adblock is hosting their own apk. If you will be providing it to third party stores can you post the md5 so we can verify that the download hasnt been corrupted or tampered with?
Its only an issue for the initial installation and you can always perform that one from our website. An APK file isnt just a zip file  its signed. Of course somebody can sign it with a different certificate. However you will then get a message that the update erases all the data. On the other hand if on update it says your data is kept then its safe to be installed  still signed with the same certificate.
All this is only true on Android systems where code signing works of course (http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Android-s-code-signing-can-be-bypassed-1911409.html).
Google should have done this sooner. As a developer I rely on advertisements to finance the development of my app. With that I try to cover the costs for the rather pricy server architecture on which my apps rely. Users with an adblocker only generate costs in my infrastructure so I actually have to PAY for them using my app.
(And no making a paid version simply is NOT an option right now as Ive seen similar apps getting killed because their income dried up while still having the same costs in their pricy infrastructure.)
Thats why I really hate adblockers. They make me LOSE money (instead of not generating income) and represent a direct danger to the future existence of my app.
Huhh Advertising may make the CURRENT Internet work (for a few wealthy stakeholders) but I dream of days where Internet marketing was heavily regulated and/or banned altogether. Googles ads are okay because most of the time theyre just text and nearly invisible to our trained eyes. But if blasting a flash ad in a new buried tab at 5 in the morning on me is the only way you can find work youre doing it wrong. Plenty of people like me also make Internet stuff and use Adblock because weve seen the sheer horror of what some people do to the Internet. 14 tracking beacons on a single page? And you wonder why your career is insecure? These developers are getting quite loud about this so let me say this on record  YOU are breaking the Internet. If your website cannot function without loading an ad that I wont look at anyway and in many cases even if it wont load without javascript available you are the reason we <3 Adblock. Extremely overpriced American telecom makes the Internet work for me youre actually standing in the way!
Thank you. I dont trust any other like my adblock.
Google doesnt lose a dime because people block ads.
The reason why is: Those who block the ads would never click on them or buy anything from those ads anyway even when they are showing.

Google Busted With Hand in Safari-Browser Cookie Jar
Google intentionally circumvented the default privacy settings of Apples Safari browser using a backdoor to set cookies on browsers set to reject them in the latest privacy debacle for the search and advertising giant.
Google immediately disabled the practice after the Wall Street Journal disclosed the practice Thursday night which was discovered by Stanford researcher Jonathan Mayer and confirmed by security consultant Ashkan Soltani.
Safari which accounts for about 6% of desktop browsing and more than 50% of mobile browsing is the only major browser to block so-called third-party cookies by default. When you visit a website all browsers including Safari allow that site to put a small tracking file on your computer which allows the site to identify a unique user track what theyve done and remember settings. However many sites also have Facebook Like buttons ads served by third parties weather widgets powered by other sites or comment systems run by a third party.
Safari blocks the sites that power those services from setting or reading cookies so a Facebook widget on a third-party site for instance cant tell if you are logged in so it cant load a personalized widget. Google along with a number of ad servers were caught by Mayer avoiding this block using a loophole in Safari that lets third parties set cookies if the browser thinks you are filling out an online form. (See a good technical overview here.)
Googles rationale seems to be that Apples default settings dont adhere to standard web practices and dont actually reflect what users want since the browser never asks users if thats the privacy setting they want. Facebook even goes so far as to suggest to outside developers that getting around the block is a best practice linking to a developers blog postfrom 2010 that includes sample code on how to circumvent the block.
Google said it used the backdoor so that it could place +1 buttons on ads it places around the web via its Adsense program so that logged-in Google+ users could press the button to share an ad. Without the work-around the button wouldnt be able to tell Google which Google account to link the button to.
Now if Safari werent so dominant on mobile to the popularity of the iPhone itd hardly be worth the code to get at the 6% of desktop users.
But more to the point if this is a problem for Google and Facebook and if the defaults actually do mess with users expectations it would seem that there are better ways to bring attention to the issue than getting busted working around them. It may not be Apples first priority to help Facebook and Google but I likewise doubt that Apple is intentionally trying to ruin user experience in order to hobble Facebook Google and online ad networks.
As for Google I would expect a new round of calls for hearings and perhaps even a fine from the FTC which has already imposed mandatory privacy audits on Google for 20 years. And my new shorthand for how companies should deal with privacy  Dont be a secretive jerk  applies here as well. Google may or may not have been a jerk in this case  that depends on your perspective but its clear it was sneaky and secretive.
Given that Google announced it is backtracking on its privacy promises to users in order to create the mother of all online profiles by combining the data you give it to nearly all of its services that secrecy may be more disturbing than the crime itself.

pri_250_db,"50m evernote accounts compromised, email addresses.txt","You probably heard about the Target data breach that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of the retail giant's customers into the hands of cybercriminals in late 2013. But Target's security nightmare wasn't the worst data breach in history.
Here are the 10 worst data breaches in history  so far.
Heartland Payment Systems 2008-2009: 130 million records compromised
In early 2009 this Princeton New Jersey-based payment processor announced the largest data breach ever to affect an American company. Heartland's breach exposed information from approximately 130 million credit and debit cards to cybercriminals.
Malware planted on Heartland's network recorded card data as it arrived from retailers. Because the company processed payments for more than 250000 businesses across the country the impact was huge.
In 2010 Albert Gonzalez the convicted mastermind behind the Heartland breach (as well as another huge breach) was sentenced to 20 years in prison  the longest sentence ever handed down for computer crime in a U.S. court.
Target Stores 2013: 110 million records compromised
In December 2013 retail giant Target confirmed that hackers had infected the company's payment-card readers making off with approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers that had been used at Target stores in the United States during the 2013 post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.
In January 2014 Target announced that the contact information  full names addresses email addresses and telephone numbers  of 70 million customers had also been compromised. Some of those customers probably also had credit-card data compromised in the earlier breach but it's possible that as many as 110 million people were affected by the Target breaches.
Sony online entertainment services 2011: 102 million records compromised
In April 2011 attackers whose identities are still unknown targeted the PlayStation Network that links Sony's home gaming consoles as well as Sony Online Entertainment which hosts massively multiplayer online PC games and the Qriocity video- and music-streaming service.
Initially Sony said that only the personal information of 78 million PlayStation Network users  login credentials names addresses phone numbers and email addresses  had been exposed. But the tally of compromised accounts rose by 24.6 million when investigators discovered the attackers had also penetrated SOE and Qriocity. The credit-card data of approximately 23400 SOE users in Europe was also stolen.
Following the initial breach disclosure the PlayStation Network went dark worldwide for more than three weeks. In May 2011 Sony estimated its cleanup costs  which included fighting 65 class-action lawsuits brought against the company  at $171 million.
National Archive and Records Administration 2008: 76 million records compromised
Not all data breaches are the result of criminal activity. In late 2008 a hard drive at the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) stopped working. It held the names contact information and Social Security numbers of 76 million U.S. military veterans.
Instead of being destroyed on-site the drive was sent for repair to a government contractor which determined the drive could not be fixed  so it was sent it out to be scrapped. It is not clear whether the drive was actually destroyed.
Following complaints by an IT manager at NARA an investigation was launched and NARA changed its policies to destroy all malfunctioning storage media containing sensitive personal information.
""NARA does not believe that a breach of PII [personally identifiable information] occurred and therefore does not believe that notification [of the affected veterans] is necessary or appropriate at this time"" the agency told Wired News in 2009.
Anthem 2015: 69 million to 80 million records compromisedIn February 2015 Anthem formerly known as WellPoint and the second-largest health insurer in the U.S. revealed its customer database had been breached. Stolen data included names addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers and employment histories  everything an identity thief might need. As many as 80 million current and former customers were thought to be affected.
Epsilon 2011: 60 million to 250 million records compromised
In March 2011 the Texas-based marketing firm Epsilon which handled email communications for more than 2500 clients worldwide  including seven Fortune 10 companies  announced that databases pertaining to about 50 Epsilon clients had been stolen.
Email addresses of at least 60 million customers ended up in the hands of cybercriminals and more than a dozen major retailers banks hotels and other companies were affected including Best Buy JPMorgan Chase Capital One Bank and Verizon.
Epsilon could not confirm exactly how many individuals were affected. Conservative estimates put the number of email addresses stolen at 60 million but according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a San Diego-based nonprofit advocacy group the number may have been as high as 250 million.
Home Depot 2014: 56 million payment cards compromised
In September 2014 hardware and building-supplies warehouse retailer Home Depot admitted what had been suspected for weeks. Beginning in April or May of the same year ""carders"" had infected its point-of-sale systems at stores in the U.S. and Canada with malware that pretended to be antivirus software but instead stole customer credit and debit cards.
The theft may have been the largest haul of payment cards resulting from a direct attack on a retailer if the lower estimate from the TJX breach (see below) is accepted. But unlike the Target theft less than a year earlier the Home Depot theft didn't result in customers staying away nor did it generate quite the same media outcry.
Evernote 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In March 2013 users of the note-taking and archiving service Evernote learned that their email addresses usernames and encrypted passwords had been exposed by a security breach. No financial data was stolen and the company confirmed that none of the user-generated content on its servers had been compromised.
However as had been the case for those affected by Epsilon's 2011 breach Evernote users who had their usernames and email addresses stolen were vulnerable to spam emails and phishing campaigns  some of which pretended to be password-reset emails coming from Evernote itself.
Living Social 2013: More than 50 million records compromised
In April 2013 Living Social a daily-deals site partly owned by Amazon announced that the names email addresses birth dates and encrypted passwords of more than 50 million customers worldwide had been stolen by hackers. Twenty million Living Social customers whose information was stored on servers in Asia were not affected.
TJX Companies Inc. 2006-2007: At least 46 million records compromised
When it was discovered in 2007 the TJX data breach was the biggest theft of consumer data ever in the United States affecting the parent company of several major retail brands including Marshalls T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. At least 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period but some estimates put the number at closer to 90 million.
About 450000 TJX customers also had their personally identifiable information stolen including driver's license numbers. The breach ultimately cost the Framingham Massachusetts-based company $256 million.
The TJX hackers included Albert Gonzalez who was cooperating with law-enforcement investigations into earlier data thefts when he took part in both the TJX breach and the even larger Heartland Payment Systems attack two years later.
Honorable mention: Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014: Company's inner workings completely exposed
On Nov. 24 2014 staffers at Sony Pictures Entertainment the movie and television production division of Sony had their computer screens hijacked by a grinning skull. A group calling itself Guardians of Peace said it had taken over the corporate network and would release detailed company information online if unspecified demands weren't met. Within days gigabytes of internal Sony Pictures data appeared on file-sharing sites including Social Security numbers and scanned passports belonging to actors and executives internal passwords unpublished scripts marketing plans financial and legal information and even four entire unreleased Sony movies.
The company's 6800 employees plus an estimated 40000 other individuals the company had paid over previous years were placed at dire risk of identity theft and rival Hollywood studios got a detailed blueprint of Sony Pictures' accounts future plans and internal workings.Some rumors blamed North Korea others disgruntled insiders. Whatever the cause the incident threatened the very survival of Sony Pictures Entertainment as a company and may be the most damaging corporate data breach ever.

Most Presidential Campaign Websites Fail Privacy Test Survey Finds
Political campaign websites are designed to raise money and collect personal information such as email addresses for future solicitations. The sites may also ask for your age sex education and ethnicity in order to better target this follow-up marketing.
Ever wonder how well these campaign sites protect that information or if they share it?
The nonprofit nonpartisan Online Trust Alliance (OTA) recently audited the websites for 23 presidential candidates (including those of so-called third-party White House wannabes) to examine their security consumer protection and privacy practices. This was done anonymously and without the sites' participation.
Carly Fiorina's website got a failing grade. carlyforpresident.com
Only six received a ""passing"" grade on privacy. The other 17 (74 percent) failed mainly due to their privacy policies or absence of one. Four did not have a privacy policy at all.
The OTA report (2016 Presidential Candidates Online Trust Audit) noted that since the infrastructure for these websites is new and for limited purposes ""the adoption of security and privacy best practices should be relatively straightforward.""
""We naively felt that they would have been more in tune with privacy principles but based on the results we were wrong"" said Craig Spiezle OTA's executive director. ""The vast majority of these sites fail to adhere to fair information privacy practices (FIPPS) which ironically one of the candidates will have to uphold if they become president.""
The six sites making OTA's Honor Roll are those of Republicans Jeb Bush Chris Christie Rick Santorum and Scott Walker who has ended his campaign and Democrats Lincoln Chafee and Martin O'Malley.
Christie had the only site that made it possible for supporters to opt out of having their personal information sold or shared the report noted.

The site for Republican Ted Cruz is at the other extreme it said. Its privacy policy says the campaign ""may periodically access your contact list and/or address book on your mobile device"" and that by registering on the site you're giving them ""your express consent"" to do that.
Spiezle told NBC News that OTA contacted all 23 presidential campaigns to ask for a comment and offer its help. Only one responded: the campaign of Republican candidate Bobby Jindahl  with a threat to take legal action according to Spiezle.
NBC News emailed all of the major candidates whose sites received failing grade but did not receive any responses.
The report found that on the whole the sites audited have ""excellent security configurations"" but it advised the campaigns not to be complacent.
It warned the campaign sites that they are ""breaches waiting to happen"" as they are ""prime targets for people motivated by the commercial value of the data politics or hactivism.""
One area singled out for improvement: campaign email. The majority of the candidates' email systems ""are still exposed to the possibility of email being spoofed or forged"" the report concluded. This could result in scams or malware being delivered to their supporters.

Privacy experts compare presidential primary campaigns to start-ups. Everyone is in a rush to get it done now and they may cut corners because they know they may not be around in a few months.
""This is an incredibly temporary infrastructure for most being thrown together as quickly as possible"" said Chris Babel CEO of TRUSTe an online privacy management service. ""When you reach out to 20 venders to assemble a campaign and you want it up and running in a matter of months some of these things get dropped.""
That might explain why the privacy policy on the Bush campaign website includes a section on ""contests sweepstakes and other promotions.""
""On the Site you may wish to participate in contests and other promotions that we may offer from time to time"" it says. ""Through these promotions you may choose to participate in activities such as sharing information found on the Site with others and sending e-mail invitations. In connection with any contests and other promotions that we may offer from time to time via the Site we use the information you provide to administer the contests and other promotions.""
OTA's Spiezle told NBC News the wording suggests that the site developer simply ""copied and pasted a privacy policy from another site without any sensitivity or awareness of the context.""
""If this were any major site it would be quite a cause for alarm"" he said.
The OTA audit found that most campaigns stated in their privacy policies that they might share any personal information collected from supporters with any ""like-minded"" organizations.
For instance the privacy policy on Democrat Hillary Clinton's website advises that personal information may be shared with a wide variety of people businesses and organizations:
""With vendors consultants and other service providers or volunteers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf"" it says. ""With candidates organizations campaigns groups or causes that we believe have similar goals and with organizations that facilitate communications and information sharing among such groups.""
So if you share your personal information with a candidate you should expect to receive solicitations from other candidates in that party and maybe from the party itself.
""It shouldn't be a surprise that candidates share information"" said Jules Polonetsky executive director of the Future of Privacy Forum.
The privacy policy on Republican Carly Fiorina's campaign website is the only one that makes it clear the campaign reserves the right to do that:
""Carly for President may provide or sell your email address or other personal information to third parties for fundraising or other purposes"" it says. ""Additionally we may share your personal information with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you.""
The Clinton website also says it might sell personal information collected but only in certain situations such as reorganization or formation of a new or successor organization. It does not explain who it could sell the data to in those circumstances.
Very few people read privacy policies. So it's best to assume that if you provide your personal information to a political candidate or party it's going to be shared. If this concerns you and you still want to help the campaign you might consider using a disposable email address when you sign up on the website and limit the information you provide.
Privacy experts would like to see the candidates take this issue more seriously. In an ""Open Letter to the Presidential Candidates"" OTA's Craig Spiezle calls on the parties and the candidates to make respect for privacy a part of their political platforms.
It's a candidate's ""duty to protect and be a steward of the data and personally identifiable information voters entrust to them"" he wrote.

C.I.A. Report Finds Concerns With Ties to New York Police
Four Central Intelligence Agency officers were embedded with the New York Police Department in the decade after Sept. 11 2001 including one official who helped conduct surveillance operations in the United States according to a newly disclosed C.I.A. inspector generals report.
That officer believed there were no limitations on his activities the report said because he was on an unpaid leave of absence and thus exempt from the prohibition against domestic spying by members of the C.I.A.Another embedded C.I.A. analyst  who was on its payroll  said he was given unfiltered police reports that included information unrelated to foreign intelligence the C.I.A. report said.
The once-classified review completed by the C.I.A. inspector general in December 2011 found that the four agency analysts  more than had previously been known  were assigned at various times to provide direct assistance to the local police. The report also raised a series of concerns about the relationship between the two organizations.The C.I.A. inspector general David B. Buckley found that the collaboration was fraught with irregular personnel practices that it lacked formal documentation in some important instances and that there was inadequate direction and control by agency supervisors.While negative public perception is to be expected from the revelation of the agencys close and direct collaboration with any local domestic police department a perception that the agency has exceeded its authorities diminishes the trust placed in the organization Mr. Buckley wrote in a cover memo to David H. Petraeus then the C.I.A. director.The declassification of the executive summary in response to a Freedom of Information Act suit comes at a time of intense interest in domestic spying after leaks by a former contractor for the National Security Agency.It also comes amid lawsuits against the Police Department alleging unconstitutional surveillance of Muslim communities and mosques in New Jersey and New York. And a group of plaintiffs from a 1971 lawsuit over harassment of political groups by the Police Departments so-called Red Squad has asked a judge to tighten guidelines stemming from that case on police investigations involving political or religious activity.
Paul J. Browne a police spokesman said that the lawsuits were without merit. He also said that the inspector general had found nothing illegal and that the last embedded C.I.A. official left the police in 2012.Were proud of our relationship with C.I.A. and its training he said saying it was partly responsible for the absence of casualties from a terror attack in New York in the years since Sept. 11 and the anthrax attacks. He added that the terrorists keep coming and we keep pushing back.The C.I.A.-Police Department partnership dates from 2002 when David Cohen a former C.I.A. officer who became deputy commissioner for intelligence at the Police Department after the Sept. 11 attacks reached out to his former agency in building up its counterterrorism abilities.
The inspector generals office began the investigation in August 2011 after The Associated Press published an article about the C.I.A.s relationship with the Police Departments intelligence division. It was part of a series about New York police surveillance of Muslims that was later awarded a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.When the classified report was completed in 2011 spokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Police Department said it had concluded that the C.I.A. had not violated a law and an executive order that prohibited it from domestic spying or performance of law-enforcement powers. But the document shows that that conclusion was not the whole story. The inspector general warned in his cover letter that the collaboration raised considerable and multifaceted risks for the agency.
This week it released an executive summary and cover memo in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center a nonprofit civil-liberties group which provided it to The New York Times.The C.I.A. is not permitted to engage in domestic surveillance said Ginger McCall the director of the groups Open Government Project. Despite the assurances of the C.I.A.s press office the activities documented in this report cross the line and highlight the need for more oversight.Dean Boyd a C.I.A. spokesman said the inspector general found no legal violations or evidence that the agencys support to the Police Department constituted domestic spying.
It should come as no surprise that after 9/11 the C.I.A. stepped up its cooperation with law enforcement on counterterrorism issues or that some of that increased cooperation was in New York he said in an e-mail. The agencys operational focus however is overseas and none of the support we have provided to N.Y.P.D. can rightly be characterized as domestic spying by the C.I.A. Any suggestion along those lines is simply wrong.The report shows that the first of the four embedded agency officers began as an adviser in 2002 and went on an unpaid leave from the agency from 2004 to 2009. During that latter period it said he participated in  and directed  N.Y.P.D. investigations operations and surveillance activities directed at U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons.The official received a Police Department paycheck. He told the inspector general that he did not consider himself an agency officer and believed he had no limitations as far as what he could or could not do. C.I.A. lawyers said that officials on unpaid leave who are acting in a personal capacity and not subject to C.I.A. direction are not constrained by the law barring the agency from domestic security functions the report said.Another C.I.A. analyst was detailed to the Police Department in early 2008 and remained on the agencys payroll. From about February to April 2008 he told the inspector general he had received daily files including the police intelligence divisions investigative reports that he believed were unfiltered.
That meant they had not been prescreened to remove information unrelated to foreign intelligence information like evidence of domestic criminal activity. Later the report says the system was changed and police analysts gave him printouts of only those reports deemed to have potential foreign-intelligence information  about 10 to 12 a day.Still a former Police Department intelligence analyst who now works for the C.I.A.s National Clandestine Service maintained that the embedded C.I.A. official had not had unrestricted or unfiltered access to the reports. The inspector general did not clear up the discrepancy.
Meanwhile the Police Department sent a detective to the C.I.A. from October 2008 to November 2009 to receive agency operational training to enhance the capability of its intelligence divisions counterterrorism efforts in the metropolitan area.Two other agency officials also worked for a period at the Police Department. One spent considerable time and effort trying to help N.Y.P.D. improve its volatile relationship with the local F.B.I. and the report said senior agency officials expressed concern that the arrangement had placed the agency in the middle of a contentious relationship.The revelation of these issues Mr. Buckley wrote leads me to conclude that the risks associated with the Agencys relationship with the N.Y.P.D. were not fully considered and that there was inadequate direction and control by the agency managers responsible for the relationship.

Insurance: how a simple query could cost you a premium penalty
Even if you don't make a claim calling to see if you are covered is logged  and the result can be very expensive
Simply calling in a plumber can end up less expensive than asking if your insurance policy coveres the problem. Photograph: Gary Ombler/Getty Images
Dropped your mobile down the loo and wondering if you can claim on your home insurance? Not sure if that leak in the kitchen ceiling is covered by your policy? You might naturally call your insurer to find out. But if you do the information you give could be held against you  even if you do not make a claim  and raise future premiums by hundreds of pounds.
In my case the quote from the cheapest insurer I found on gocompare.com  from Admiral  went from about 213 to 435.50 when it found out that my partner and I had called up esure our previous insurer twice during our policy term to ask if we could claim for such incidents.
Esure had logged these in a central database used by most UK insurers the Claims and Underwriting Exchange even though we had not claimed. Insurers can log incidents ""which may or may not give rise to a claim"". This is in the interests of preventing fraud but they also use it to assess the likelihood someone will claim in future.
""It's absurd that calls that do not result in a claim should affect your record"" says Steve Foulsham head of technical services at the British Insurance Brokers' Association (Biba). ""It really doesn't stack up. If no claim is made that incident should be filed as 'no payment' in the database. It is unfairly treating people who do the right thing by calling up to notify their insurer. Even worse is that most people do not know that this information is being logged in a way that can potentially be used against them even for incidents that do not necessarily make them more risky.""
However Adrian Webb spokesman for esure claims this is not that common: ""Unfortunately you found yourself in a small niche. Incidents affecting future premiums are rare in general and even more rare in home.""
Yet reporting our leak pushed up the premium with Admiral to 316 while the accidental damage to the phone pushed it up to 435.50 despite no claim.
It is worth knowing that any leak reported to a home insurer is likely to result in a black mark on your record. The galling thing is that there is no opportunity to explain what happened. In our case the bath had slipped and dislodged a pipe  one plumber and plasterer later and it was fixed all for less than the excess. Is there any way I can record this information in our file?
""Unfortunately incident records are not like a credit record that can be corrected"" says Webb ""and insurers take a broad brush approachThey have to because they cannot justify the cost of going into detail over the personal histories of every applicant.""
Admiral said: ""We take into account all incidents regardless of whether a claim has been made as we have to price a premium based on the risk presented to us.""
But with such premium hikes at stake for mere phone calls you would be forgiven for thinking twice before phoning to make any inquiries. ""There's a very fine line between not unduly arousing attention for a minor issue and material non-disclosure of an incident which would be in breach of policy terms"" says Webb.
Another industry expert says: ""It might be helpful to know that insurers work on the basis that if someone feels they should tell you about something it gets recorded."" Surely we should know this? ""Perhaps but then insurers run the risk that if everyone knows those calls are logged people would not report incidents that would be of justifiable concern.""
And it seems there are no rules on how insurers can use this data or whether they should tell customers they might use it. The Association of British Insurers has previously said only that: ""We would expect the insurer to make it clear the impact that [a report of an incident] could have."" As I found out this does not always happen.
If you are worried previous incidents may be held and used against you the best thing to do when you next obtain insurance is to use a broker. Then says Foulsham ""you have the opportunity to explain the circumstances to a human being who can put into context any incidents to insurers which can hopefully deliver a cheaper premium"".
And if you think a price comparison site offers an opportunity to let previous incidents go undetected think again. There are ways insurers can see if you are trying to avoid disclosure. Nicola Parry of moneysupermarket.com says: ""Insurers can now tell if a person has entered a claim in their application obtained the premium then gone back to the form and removed the claim to reduce it.""

Privacy and Press Freedom Collide in University Case
It was bad enough for the University of Illinois when The Chicago Tribunes 2009 series Clout Goes to College exposed the existence of a clout list that over five years gave hundreds of well-connected students an edge in admissions and led to the resignations of the university president the chancellor of the flagship Urbana-Champaign campus and most of the trustees.
But two years later the university is still mired in litigation before the federal appeals court in Chicago fighting the release of more documents the newspaper has asked for including the names and addresses of the parents on the clout list. The university has turned over about 5200 pages of documents to the newspaper. But in a separate state court proceeding The Tribune is seeking the grade point averages and ACT scores of the students accepted from the clout list.Those requests set off a shootout between the states freedom of information law and the federal privacy law for educational records.
U. of Illinois Admissions Process Was Tainted Panel FindsAUG. 6 2009
The university backed by the big guns of academia argues that the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or Ferpa forbids disclosure of such information  and threatens the loss of federal financing if it hands over private records. Personal information about students is precisely what the federal privacy act was designed to protect it said raising the specter of a world in which students might be shamed by the public release of their academic credentials.If you give me the parents name and address and identify the students sponsor I can identify the student said Sam Skinner a lawyer for the university. Basically what this comes down to is whether a students name or sources that would reveal his name are protected by Ferpa and we believe Congress meant to protect students personalized information.Mr. Skinner said the universitys position is that anything anyone sends in about any applicant is a student record protected by the law.But The Tribune backed by media groups including The New York Times argues that the documents are not education records under the federal law but rather records of questionable conduct so the publics right to know should prevail.When Governor Blagojevich calls the chancellor and says Admit this favored person thats not an admission record kept in someones file said James Klenk a lawyer for The Tribune. Thats something that should be disclosed to the public. Were investigating public officials in their decision making. Some people were admitted not on their merits while other people on the merits didnt get those spots and thats wrong.A friend-of-the-court brief for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Student Press Law Center joined by leading media organizations including The New York Times said that all too often the privacy act was abused.This case presents the increasingly familiar tale of a public university that embarrassed by its own wrongdoing cries student privacy in an attempt to frustrate public disclosure of information reflecting unflatteringly on the conduct of the universitys administrators the brief said.
That same argument it said has been used before: by administrators at Florida State University seeking to conceal correspondence with the N.C.A.A. about preferential academic assistance for athletes; officials at Laramie County Community College in Wyoming trying to conceal a report about the college presidents behavior on an overseas trip; and those at the University of North Carolina trying to conceal records regarding an athlete parking ticket scandal.Parents and university officials who used the clout list to bypass the merit-based application process the brief said cannot now claim any reasonable right to privacy to cover their actions as it is far outweighed by the newsworthiness of the scandal and the right of the public to hold accountable those responsible for perpetrating a fraud.Judge Joan B. Gottschall of Federal District Court who heard The Tribunes motion for a summary judgment in March sided with the newspaper. She ruled that although Ferpa does provide penalties for releasing protected student information it does not actually prohibit such releases because universities could choose to release the information and face the possible loss of federal money  hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of the University of Illinois. That suggestion galvanized academia.The decision that came out of the district court has made institutions nervous because the decision essentially put to the university the Hobsons choice of declining or returning federal money or violating a court order telling it to comply with the freedom of information law said Ada Meloy general counsel of the American Council on Education one of the groups that signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief backing the university. The Justice Department also filed a brief in support of the university.But the threat of losing federal financing is an empty one in this case. At the oral argument before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit the judges referred to a letter from the Department of Education saying it had no plans to ask the university to forfeit its federal financing.At oral arguments last month the panel seemed inclined to accept the argument that there was a strong public interest in the records being sought.They want to know who are these families what are their connections? Judge Richard A. Posner said. Thats legitimate thats important.But the judges sounded skeptical that they should be the ones deciding the case given that the open-records law being invoked was an Illinois statute. I dont understand what this case is doing in federal court said Judge Frank H. Easterbrook who asked for supplemental briefs on the jurisdiction question.But one way or another  in one court or another  the question will have to be resolved.This is an honest disagreement between The Tribune and the university about whats protected Mr. Skinner said.

pri_250_db,us office of personnel management hackers gain acc.txt,"Office of Personnel Management data breach - Wikipedia the free encyclopedia
In June 2015 the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people.[1] Later FBI Director James Comey put the number at 18 million.[2] The data breach which had started in March 2014 and may have started earlier was noticed by the OPM in April 2015.[1][3] It has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.[1] Information targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers[4] as well as names dates and places of birth and addresses.[5] The hack went deeper than initially believed and likely involved theft of detailed security-clearance-related background information. One victim wrote that the OPM is the agency that asks your neighbors what they know about you that could be used to blackmail you.[6][7][8]
On July 9 2015 the estimate of the number of stolen records had increased to 21.5 million. This included records of people who had undergone background checks but who were not necessarily current or former government employees.[9] Soon after Katherine Archuleta the director of OPM and former National Political Director for Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign resigned.
The New York Times had reported that the infiltration was discovered using United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)'s Einstein intrusion-detection program and it predated the Einstein deployment which began a year earlier.[10] However the Wall Street Journal Wired Ars Technica and Fortune later reported that it was unclear how the breach was discovered. It may have been a product demonstration of CyFIR a commercial forensic product from a Manassas Virginia security company CyTech Services that uncovered the infiltration.[11][12][13][14] These reports were subsequently confirmed by CyTech Services in a press release issued by the company on June 15 2015[15] to clarify contradictions made by OPM spokesman Sam Schumach in a later edit of the Fortune[11] article.
On June 11 2015 ABC News also said that highly sensitive 127-page Standard Forms (SF) 86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions) were put at serious risk by the hack. SF-86 forms contain information about family members college roommates foreign contacts and psychological information. At the time OPM stated that family members names were not compromised.[6] However on June 13 2015 OPM spokesman Samuel Schumach said that investigators had ""a high degree of confidence that OPM systems containing information related to the background investigations of current former and prospective federal government employees and those for whom a federal background investigation was conducted may have been exfiltrated.""[7] The Central Intelligence Agency however does not use the OPM system; therefore it may not have been affected.[3]

David Cox president of the American Federation of Government Employees wrote in a letter to OPM director Katherine Archuleta (obtained by the Associated Press) that based on the incomplete information that the AFGE had received from OPM ""We believe that the Central Personnel Data File was the targeted database and that the hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee every federal retiree and up to one million former federal employees.""[16] Cox stated that the AFGE believes that the breach compromised military records veterans' status information addresses dates of birth job and pay history health insurance and life insurance information pension information and data on age gender and race.[16]
The stolen data included 5.6 million sets of fingerprints.[17] Biometrics expert Ramesh Kesanupalli said that because of this secret agents were no longer safe as they could be identified by their fingerprints even if their names had been changed.[18]
According to the Wall Street Journal U.S. government officials suspect that Chinese hackers perpetrated the breach.[1] The Washington Post has also reported that the attack originated in China citing unnamed government officials.[5] China has responded to these claims by noting that it has been the target of cyberattacks in the past.[19] It remains unclear whether the attack if it originated from China was sponsored by China's government or not.[10] U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Andy Ozment testified that the attackers had gained valid user credentials to the systems they were attacking likely through social engineering. Ars Technica reported that at least one worker with root access to every row in every database was physically located in China. Another contractor had two employees with Chinese passports.[20]
Whether the attack was motivated by commercial gain remains unclear.[10] It has been suggested that hackers working for the Chinese military intend to compile a database of Americans using the data obtained from the breach.[19]
The OPM had been warned multiple times of security vulnerabilities and failings. A March 2015 OPM Office of the Inspector General semi-annual report to Congress warned of ""persistent deficiencies in OPM's information system security program"" including ""incomplete security authorization packages weaknesses in testing of information security controls and inaccurate Plans of Action and Milestones.""[21][22]
A July 2014 story in The New York Times quoted unnamed senior American officials saying that Chinese hackers had broken into OPM. The officials said that the hackers seemed to be targeting files on workers who had applied for security clearances and had gained access to several databases but had been stopped before they obtained the security clearance information. In an interview later that month Katherine Archuleta the director of OPM said that the most important thing was that no personal identification information had been compromised.[3][23][24]
Some lawmakers made calls for Archuleta to resign citing mismanagement and that she was a political appointee and former Obama campaign official with no degree or experience in human resources. She responded neither she nor OPM chief information officer Donna Seymour would do so. ""I am committed to the work that I am doing at OPM"" Archuleta told reporters. ""I have trust in the staff that is there.""[9] On July 10 2015 Archuleta resigned as OPM director.[25]
Daniel Henninger deputy editorial page director of the Wall Street Journal speaking on Fox News' Journal Editorial Report criticized the appointment of Archuleta to be ""in charge of one of the most sensitive agencies"" in the U.S. government saying: ""What is her experience to run something like that? She was the national political director of Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. She's also the head of something called the Latina Initiative. She's a politico right? ... That is the kind of person they have put in.""[26]
Security experts have stated that the biggest problem with the breach was not the failure to prevent remote break-ins but the absence of mechanisms to detect outside intrusion and the lack of proper encryption of sensitive data. OPM CIO Donna Seymour countered that criticism by pointed to the agency's aging systems as the primary obstacle to putting such protections in place despite having encryption tools available. DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications Andy Ozment explained further that ""If an adversary has the credentials of a user on the network then they can access data even if it's encrypted just as the users on the network have to access data and that did occur in this case. So encryption in this instance would not have protected this data.""[27]
A July 22 2015 memo by Inspector General Patrick McFarland said that OPM's Chief Information Officer Donna Seymour was slowing his investigation into the breach leading him to wonder whether or not she was acting in good faith. He did not raise any specific claims of misconduct but he did say that her office was fostering an ""atmosphere of mistrust"" by giving him ""incorrect or misleading"" information.[28]

Spotify Revamps New Privacy Policy After User Backlash
Spotify has revamped its new privacy policy as company CEO Daniel Ek kept his promise to protect the privacy of the music streaming service's users.(Photo : Spotify)
Spotify has revamped its new privacy policy for a clearer explanation on how the music streaming service utilizes the data of its users after the company faced backlash from the vague language that it used for the controversial policy that was released last month.
The new privacy policy which took effect last Aug. 19 requiredusers to agree that their information which Spotify gathers will be used shared and processed by the service including media files pictures details of contacts and the location of the user.
It was unclear on why Spotify would need such information in carrying out its music streaming service but users were being forced to agree to the policy if they wanted to continue using Spotify.
The new privacy policy sparked outrage and criticism from users due to privacy concerns which promptedSpotify CEO Daniel Ek to issue an apology to the public regarding the matter clarifying certain aspects of the policy and promising to protect the privacy of the service's users.
""If you don't want to share this kind of information you don't have to. We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data - and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience"" explained Ek.
It seems that Ek is following through with his promise as Spotify has now released a revamped updated privacy policy with a plain-language introduction that looks to be a clear statement on Spotify's principles and approach regarding user privacy.
""We hope it provides a healthy dose of clarity and context too"" wroteEk in the Spotify blog post that announces the updated policy.
The preface states that Spotify will only collect data either to help run the music streaming service or to provide more features to users. For the second purpose Spotify will be asking for the permission of the user before accessing data such as pictures location voice data sharing or contacts. If the user would choose to allow Spotify to access such information the user can at any time choose to revoke the permission.
Spotify said that the revamped privacy policy will be received by users over the next few days and weeks including users that already agreed to the controversial version of the policy.

NHS-accredited health apps putting users privacy at risk study finds
Researchers found some of the smartphone apps sent unencrypted personal and medical details over the internet  putting users at risk of identity theft and fraud
Earlier this month the health secretary said he wanted to get 15% of NHS patients checking medical records on apps within next 12 months.
Last modified on Friday 25 September 2015 06.15EDT
Smartphone health apps backed by the NHS could be putting users privacy unnecessarily at risk according to a study.
Researchers from Imperial College London investigated how data was handled by apps endorsed by the NHS health apps library and found several sent unencrypted personal and medical information over the internet  putting users at risk of identity theft and fraud.
They said the findings questioned the trustworthiness of NHS accreditation at a time when health apps covering a wide range of topics from weight loss to pregnancy were used by an estimated half a billion people across the world.
It comes after the government announced that patients could soon access their medical records by smartphone and urged the NHS to adopt more mobile technology.
The library features applications reviewed by the health service to ensure they are clinically safe and comply with the Data Protection Act according to the NHS Choices website.
But a test of 79 apps listed on the service over a six-month period in 2013 found that 70 transmitted data over the internet and 38 had a specific privacy policy that did not state what information would be sent.
The study published in the journal BMC Medicine also found 23 sent identifying details without protection of which four apps sent both personal and medical information unencrypted.
The researchers used a form of hack known as a man-in-the-middle attack to capture the data sent by an app over the internet.
Lead researcher Kit Huckvale said: It is known that apps available through general marketplaces had poor and variable privacy practices for example failing to disclose personal data collected and sent to a third party.
However it was assumed that accredited apps  those that had been badged as trustworthy by organisational programmes such as the UKs NHS health apps library  would be free of such issues.
Our study suggests that the privacy of users of accredited apps may have been unnecessarily put at risk and challenges claims of trustworthiness offered by the current national accreditation scheme being run through the NHS.
The results of the study provide an opportunity for action to address these concerns and minimise the risk of a future privacy breach. To help with this we have already supplied our findings and data to the NHS health apps library.
Earlier this month the health secretary Jeremy Hunt said his ambition was to get 15% of NHS patients routinely reading and adding to their online medical records using smartphones apps within the next 12 months.

pri_250_db,script made available for determining ip address o.txt,"Skype Reveals Remote and Local IP Address Of All Online Users - gHacks Tech News
Skype Reveals Remote and Local IP Address Of All Online Users
If you are a user of the messaging software Skype you know that you can see the location of your contacts in the Skype interface. What you probably do not know is that there is currently a way to display a Skype user's remote and local IP address as well.
A script has been uploaded to Github that offers these options. According to the page it can be used to lookup IP addresses of online Skype accounts and return both the remote and the local IP of that account on a website.
This blog post reveals how the script works. It basically starts an add a Skype contact request but does not complete it. The log file will display the local and remote IP of that Skype user even if the user is not added to the list of contacts in Skype.
The script is for instance available on this site. Just enter the user name of a Skype user fill out the captcha and click the search button to initiate the lookup. You will receive the user's remote IP and port as well as the local IP and port.
This works only if the Skype user is online at the time of the lookup and not if the user is offline. The IP address can reveal the user's country of origin and maybe even the town or district. This can be done with the help of tools such as this one. Just enter a public IP address in the form and you will receive information about the provider of the IP address.
You can also use a tool like IP on Map to display the real world location of an IP address on a map.
Some Skype users may not see this as a problem at all as the IP address does not reveal a user's name or street address for instance. The IP address can however lead to those information for instance in a lawsuit.
There is currently no way of protecting yourself against the lookup of the IP address other than not logging in to Skype when the software is not needed. The only other option would be the use of a virtual private network or proxy to hide the IP address from users who look it up. (via Hacker News)
What's your take on this? Do you think Microsoft / Skype should fix the issue for instance by revealing IP addresses only after confirmation by the new contact in Skype?
Update: Here is a statement from a Skype spokesperson:
We are investigating reports of a new tool that allegedly captures a Skype users last known IP address. This is an ongoing industry-wide issue faced by all peer-to-peer software companies. We are committed to the safety and security of our customersand we are takings measures to help protect them.

Responses to Skype Reveals Remote and Local IP Address Of All Online Users
Microsoft should absolutely fix this. Skype is used by activists worldwide who would not want their IP addresses revealed to oppressive governments.
Microsoft tells us there is an inherent privacy problem with all Peer-to-peer software the reaction is outrage or fear the solution they will propose is to transit all the conversations via their servers thus making the CISPA infinitely more effective.
No they should leave it alone. How are bored internet users gonna spend their time?
Had a friend of mine go through it. When you first visit it redirects to:
http://skype-ip-finder.tk/govalidateyourself#%5Bnumbers%5D:%5Bport%5D:%5Bip%5D:%5Bport%5D/
Basically it creates a DB of everyone who visits. People who will go there will generally look themselves up which is added to the DB at the beginning then it just puts two and two together and makes the entry to the database so that your IP is applied to the username if it doesn't already have an entry (I believe). The flash object in the bottom corner is from .skype.com and is used in the ""About Skype"" section of the software so that's also nothing special.
Also as trivia the server is hosted in Amsterdam and the host IP is malicious:
http://support.clean-mx.de/clean-mx/viruses.php?ip=94.75.209.182&sort=first%20desc
Interesting. I can however use it to lookup the IP of other Skype users as well and the users over at hacker news think it is legit as well.
You can read author's article as well as comments here (in Russian):
It's probably legit. Presumably the site simply implements the scheme presented in this 2011 paper:
The issue's been known for a while (and Skype isn't the only vulnerable service).
Is there any known way to add some opacity to this? Last thing I need is a few men in black coats kicking down my door and grabbing my computer based on my router's DHCP table.
Yea. Put your tinfoil hat on. Should keep the boogies away for a bit anyway
Each application connected to the network can see your ip.
Enough of this misinformation ... you are ridiculous ...
Leaking applications and protocols are bad and therefor should be fixed.
There are people relying on not being revealed by just their ""screen-name"" in Skype. I'm not affected and don't care when one would see me IP.
If they know you are using skype and they know your IP and open port injecting software onto your system COULD be more simple as they will be using a trusted application to do so.
This ""unveiling"" is just the first step to a huge security issue.
Martin I think your IP is not obfuscated on the top part of the last screenshot (left and right of the ""Locate"" button).
You state that ""There is currently no way of protecting yourself against the lookup of the IP address"" and then contradict yourself by going on to say that there is a way --> ""The only other option would be the use of a virtual private network or proxy to hide the IP address from users who look it up.""
Why don't you just say ""The only way of protecting yourself against the lookup of the IP address is to use a virtual private network or proxy to hide the IP address from users who look it up.""?
You can't protect yourself against the lookup as the other party is still able to lookup your vpns or proxy's IP address. These usually do not add full anonymity as law enforcement and other legal parties may still get your real IP after all. I should have worded it more carefully though.
Does this work to look up a Skype user who is online on Skype but has their Skype status set to ""Invisible""?
This would be interesting to try out. Anyone tested this?
In the recent past I had set up an skype ID to have video conversation with relatives and out of blue afetr few days of my last conversation with one of them (Out of two contacts) the ring tone sounds to which I responded but there was silence on the other side. I am just curious if I can track down the originating IP and location address of such individuals just to clear my suspicion and block it for ever. I did delete my first skype ID and set up new one this time two new skype ID show up without and contact from my side.

pri_250_db,fbi agents are given more freedom to surveil and m.txt,"F.B.I. Giving Agents New Powers in Revised Manual - The New York Times

U.S.|F.B.I. Agents Get Leeway to Push Privacy Bounds
WASHINGTON  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is giving significant new powers to its roughly 14000 agents allowing them more leeway to search databases go through household trash or use surveillance teams to scrutinize the lives of people who have attracted their attention.
The F.B.I. soon plans to issue a new edition of its manual called the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide according to an official who has worked on the draft document and several others who have been briefed on its contents. The new rules add to several measures taken over the past decade to give agents more latitude as they search for signs of criminal or terrorist activity.
The F.B.I. recently briefed several privacy advocates about the coming changes. Among them Michael German a former F.B.I. agent who is now a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that it was unwise to further ease restrictions on agents power to use potentially intrusive techniques especially if they lacked a firm reason to suspect someone of wrongdoing.
Valerie E. Caproni the F.B.I. general counsel said the bureau had carefully considered each change to its operations manual.
Claiming additional authorities to investigate people only further raises the potential for abuse Mr. German said pointing to complaints about the bureaus surveillance of domestic political advocacy groups and mosques and to an inspector generals findings in 2007 that the F.B.I. had frequently misused
national security letters which allow agents to obtain information like phone records without a court order.Valerie E. Caproni the F.B.I. general counsel said the bureau had fixed the problems with the national security letters and had taken steps to make sure they would not recur. She also said the bureau which does not need permission to alter its manual so long as the rules fit within broad guidelines issued by the attorney general had carefully weighed the risks and the benefits of each change.Every one of these has been carefully looked at and considered against the backdrop of why do the employees need to be able to do it what are the possible risks and what are the controls she said portraying the modifications to the rules as more like fine-tuning than major changes.
Some of the most notable changes apply to the lowest category of investigations called an assessment. The category created in December 2008 allows agents to look into people and organizations proactively and without firm evidence for suspecting criminal or terrorist activity.Under current rules agents must open such an inquiry before they can search for information about a person in a commercial or law enforcement database. Under the new rules agents will be allowed to search such databases without making a record about their decision.
Mr. German said the change would make it harder to detect and deter inappropriate use of databases for personal purposes. But Ms. Caproni said it was too cumbersome to require agents to open formal inquiries before running quick checks. She also said agents could not put information uncovered from such searches into F.B.I. files unless they later opened an assessment.
The new rules will also relax a restriction on administering lie-detector tests and searching peoples trash. Under current rules agents cannot use such techniques until they open a preliminary investigation which  unlike an assessment  requires a factual basis for suspecting someone of wrongdoing. But soon agents will be allowed to use those techniques for one kind of assessment too: when they are evaluating a target as a potential informant.Agents have asked for that power in part because they want the ability to use information found in a subjects trash to put pressure on that person to assist the government in the investigation of others. But Ms. Caproni said information gathered that way could also be useful for other reasons like determining whether the subject might pose a threat to agents.The new manual will also remove a limitation on the use of surveillance squads which are trained to surreptitiously follow targets. Under current rules the squads can be used only once during an assessment but the new rules will allow agents to use them repeatedly. Ms. Caproni said restrictions on the duration of physical surveillance would still apply and argued that because of limited resources supervisors would use the squads only rarely during such a low-level investigation.
The revisions also clarify what constitutes undisclosed participation in an organization by an F.B.I. agent or informant which is subject to special rules  most of which have not been made public. The new manual says an agent or an informant may surreptitiously attend up to five meetings of a group before those rules would apply  unless the goal is to join the group in which case the rules apply immediately.At least one change would tighten rather than relax the rules. Currently a special agent in charge of a field office can delegate the authority to approve sending an informant to a religious service. The new manual will require such officials to handle those decisions personally.In addition the manual clarifies a description of what qualifies as a sensitive investigative matter  investigations at any level that require greater oversight from supervisors because they involve public officials members of the news media or academic scholars.The new rules make clear for example that if the person with such a role is a victim or a witness rather than a target of an investigation extra supervision is not necessary. Also excluded from extra supervision will be investigations of low- and midlevel officials for activities unrelated to their position  like drug cases as opposed to corruption for example.
The manual clarifies the definition of who qualifies for extra protection as a legitimate member of the news media in the Internet era: prominent bloggers would count but not people who have low-profile blogs. And it will limit academic protections only to scholars who work for institutions based in the United States.Since the release of the 2008 manual the assessment category has drawn scrutiny because it sets a low bar to examine a person or a group. The F.B.I. has opened thousands of such low-level investigations each month and a vast majority has not generated information that justified opening more intensive investigations.Ms. Caproni said the new manual would adjust the definition of assessments to make clear that they must be based on leads. But she rejected arguments that the F.B.I. should focus only on investigations that begin with a firm reason for suspecting wrongdoing.

Teacher sacked for posting picture of herself holding glass of wine and mug of beer on Facebook
With a pint of beer in one hand and a glass of wine in the other the worst thing you could accuse Ashley Payne of is mixing her drink.But this happy holiday snap has cost the high school teacher her job after a parent spotted it on Facebook - and complained.The picture was taken while travelling around Europe in the summer of 2009.
Costly: Ashley Payne 24 posed for this picture while travelling around Europe in the summer of 2009. It was later spotted on her Facebook page
But Miss Payne 24 was shocked when she was summoned to the head teacher's office at Apalachee High School in Winder Georgia and offered an ultimatum.She told CBS News: 'He just asked me ""Do you have a Facebook page?""
Is this the new Facebook HQ? Mark Zuckerberg set to announce relocation of his social network team
'And you know I'm confused as to why I am being asked this but I said ""Yes"" and he said ""Do you have any pictures of yourself up there with alcohol?""'He then offered her an option: resign or be suspended.She chose to resign.
Unacc-sip-table: Miss Payne was told to resign or face suspension
School officials also took offence to the use of the B-word on the page.Miss Payne is now in a bitter legal battle with the school to get her job back.
Fighter: Miss Payne talks to CBS News. She is now in a bitter legal battle with Apalachee High School in Winder Georgia to get her job back
Her lawyer Richard Storrs said: 'It would be like I went to a restaurant and I saw my daughter's teacher
sitting there with her husband having a glass of some kind of liquid.'You know is that frowned upon by the school board? Is that
illegal? Is that improper? Of course not. It's the same situation in
this case.'The English teacher later found out it was one anonymous emailer who
shopped her to the school board after seeing the picture on the social
networking site.But she is baffled how a parent could gain access
to her page when she has all her privacy settings on 'high' meaning
only her closest friends have permission to see her pictures.She
admits putting the 'offensive' snaps on Facebook but says she now feels
as if she had stashed them in a shoebox at home for them to be stolen
and showed to the headteacher.Court documents reveal that
officials warned teachers about 'unacceptable online activities'. They
claimed her page 'promoted alcohol use' and 'contained profanity'.She now wants to clear her name and claim back her job.She
added: 'I just want to be back in the classroom if not that classroom

Facebook's Privacy Incident Response: a study of geolocation sharing on Facebook MessengerAran KhannaAbstractIntroductionBackgroundMethodsResultsDiscussionReferencesDownloadAuthorsCitationDataSuggestionsNews coverage by dayIn 2012 a media outlet reported that Facebook Messenger shared
personal geolocations by defaultIn 2015 my demonstration displayed Facebook's shared data on a
map; it was downloaded over 85000 timesAfter 9 days of news coverage Facebook released an update that requires
a user's permission to share geolocationsAbstractFacebook allows users to chat among themselves on a mobile
app called Facebook Messenger. From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015
Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting
for every message sent from the Android mobile app. These locations were visible
to anyone in a group chat regardless of his or her relationship to the sender
on the Facebook social network. Noticing a lack of significant public response
to the visible nature of geo-location data on Facebook Messenger despite media
coverage dating back to 2012 I hypothesized that users were either (1) not
aware or (2) not concerned about the collection and visibility of their
geo-location data on the app. This study explored this hypothesis by testing how
the public responded to easily seeing the historical geo-location data
collected and shared by Facebook Messenger. This study also tested the response
from Facebook a company with a reputation for encouraging outside-the-box
""hacking"". I wrote a browser application that requires a Facebook user to log
into their Facebook account and then displays on a map the geo-location data
shared with that user through Facebook Messenger chats. I announced the tool in
a blog post and publicized it on Twitter and a few other online forums. The
immediate public response was that of surprise and concern over the privacy
issue raised by the collection and visibility of the geo-location data.Results summary: My tool has been downloaded over 85000
times since its release and more than 170 global news publications linked to
my post. During the first three days after release of the geo-location mapping
tool Facebook also responded by demanding that I take down the tool which I
did. Nine days after the release Facebook made sharing geo-location data an
opt-in feature allowing users to select to share personal geolocations in Facebook
Messenger although all historical geo-location data is still archived and
shared. The results of the study suggest sufficient public attention may be
necessary for redress of reported privacy concerns.IntroductionHundreds of millions of people share personal information on
Facebook. Starting in 2011 Facebook implemented initiatives focused on
""frictionless sharing"" to automatically post a user's activity on music apps
such as Spotify or news readers such as The Washington Post that use
Facebook's Open Graph to integrate their websites more closely with Facebook.
[1] This automatic posting of songs listened to and articles read was not very
popular with users and Facebook announced in May 2014 that it would decrease
the visibility of passively shared user activities on their friends' news
Regulators have also expressed privacy concerns with regard
to how Facebook handles sharing of user data. For example in Europe the
Belgian Privacy Commission found that Facebook ""fails to offer adequate control
mechanisms"" for the use of user data. Furthermore ""Facebook places too much
burden on its users [who are] expected to navigate Facebook's complex web of
settings in search of possible opt-outs."" Finally the commission stated that
""Facebook's default settings related to behavioral profiling  are particularly
Facebook Messenger an application (or ""app"") for Android and iOS mobile
devices. Messenger has the ability to share geo-location with messages. [7] When a Facebook
user sends a message from a smartphone using Messenger the user's physical
location can also be sent. Prior to a June 2015 update unless a user changed the
initial default settings of the program the app would collect and display
geo-location information with message content by default in all conversations
on the Android app including conversations in chat groups with people who are
not direct friends on Facebook's social network. When the app first installs on
a mobile device a notice appears that informs the user that the app will
collect and share geo-location information. After that notice appears the only
other indicator of location data collection and sharing is a small blue icon
next to the textbox in a conversation. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the
Messenger app with this icon highlighted in Android.

Figure 3. iOS app showing sender's location after the
recipient clicks on a message with location attached.
Other Facebook users can view shared geo-locations on the Facebook Messenger application by tapping on individual messages in their chat log which reveals a map of the location where the individual was when the message was sent (Figure 2). On iOS the application requests access to the device's geo-location data [9] and a similar interface for sharing location data in chats exists in the iOS Messenger app (Figure 3). On the desktop version of Messenger [10] geo-locations can be viewed by moving a mouse over a small pin attached to a message to reveal a similar map (Figure 4).

pins next to the messages highlighted by red boxes show that geo-location is
attached to these messages (and can be viewed by hovering the mouse over
A user can disable geo-location sharing for individual
conversations by pressing the blue icon in the app. A user can also disable geo-location
sharing at any time for all messages by going into the application settings and
finding the option to disable it. Adjusting privacy controls for location
sharing on mobile operating systems is not entirely intuitive as evidenced by the
number of popular sites that have felt the need to publish guides on how to
adjust geo-location controls. [11] Prior to the June 2015 Messenger update
location data sharing was on by default in Android. It required user permission
to become perpetually active in the iOS Messenger app. [8]
In 2012 CNET was the first major website to raise concerns
about the privacy implications of Facebook Messenger's geo-location sharing feature.
[12] A few other publications subsequently voiced concerns. [13 14] Facebook
did not take significant action to change the software in response to these
concerns and so the geo-location sharing continued to operate unchanged.
There was not significant public pressure for change after
the initial news coverage about Facebook's location sharing settings. This
raises two questions: (1) whether Facebook users knew about the geo-location
collection and sharing and (2) whether they cared about its privacy
Facebook's location data practices presented an opportunity
(1) to study how easy it is for a computer program to systematically copy the
data and (2) to test whether Facebook's initial notification on app
installation along with the options to disable geo-location sharing within the
Messenger app and through the Android and iOS system settings were sufficient
to satisfy the privacy concerns of users aware of the data sharing.
I became interested in this issue during the spring of 2015.
At the time I was a junior at Harvard College and had been offered a summer
internship position at Facebook doing software development. I had secured the
internship through Harvard's Office of Career Services' (OCS) On Campus
Interview program. The internship was a paid position starting June 1 2015
and I had signed a letter of intent to join the company although I was not to
be considered an employee until my June 1 start date meaning that I
was not privy to any proprietary information. I was attracted to work at
Facebook by the popularity of its products and its publicly professed ""hacker
MethodsMy approach was to build an extension for a common web
browser so that a person running the extension could see the geo-locations of
any Facebook user who is sending them (or a chat group they are in) messages
through Facebook Messenger. I would then make the extension publicly available
and alert the public through a blog post Twitter and online forums. This
approach made public what some may already be doing  harvesting geo-location
information about Facebook users they have been in conversations with. It also
provided transparency and feedback to users about their geo-location settings
on Facebook. If there was no reaction by users or Facebook then Facebook's
current geo-location data practices were potentially sufficient to address
privacy concerns. My expectation was that the historical pattern of lack of
public pressure on this issue evidenced from 2012 through May 2015 would continue.
lightweight program (called a ""script"") that runs on Google's popular web
browser Chrome. After a user logs into a Facebook account when the Facebook Messenger
page appears on Chrome on a desktop computer the script runs in the
background. It detects calls to update the message page requests a copy of the
content and then plots the location data associated with the content onto a map
that appears in the browser. This approach allows the extension to access all
the geo-location data delivered to the browser. The precision of the location
coordinates was accurate enough to locate a user to within a meter. It
is important to note that all the data retrieved were accessible without the extension
if a user clicked on the map icon for each message. The script did nothing
illegal or malicious; rather it accessed and displayed data already available
to the user. Furthermore the data aggregated on the map remained temporarily
in memory and was discarded when the page reloaded. A full technical overview
of the system can be seen in Figure 5. Using the extension a user can choose to
see a map of the geo-location data collected and shared by Facebook Messenger
about the user and about others users in the same chat group. Figure 7 shows a
to the Chrome Web Store marking it as unlisted so that only those with a
specific link which I shared on my blog could access it. [16] The title of
the extension on the Chrome Web Store was ""Marauder's Map"" which can be seen
in Figure 6. I also archived an open source copy of the code for the extension
in an MIT-licensed Github repository with the title ""marauders-map"". [17] This
repository contained the code and setup instructions for creating the extension
Figure 5. A graphical depiction giving a full technical
overview of the marauders-map Chrome extension. White boxes represent the
components injected by the extension. The extension consists of a Chrome
background script that copies asynchronous requests from the desktop Facebook Messenger
page to the Facebook cloud endpoint for retrieving messages and then passes
the HTTP bodies of these requests to an injected content script running on the
Facebook Messenger page. This content script then emulates the original
asynchronous request (automatically adding the appropriate headers) and plots
the location data returned by Facebook onto a map drawn using the Mapbox API.
With this base code the extension can collect data on all messages loaded onto
the page asynchronously. However owing to optimizations in how Facebook
delivers data to the browser some messages are sent embedded in the initial
HTML packet (via a protocol known as BigPipe). Using a simple asynchronous GET
request the content script pulls this HTML packet and uses a regular
expression to parse the embedded location data from the messages then plots

the Google Play store. Clicking the ""Add to Chrome"" button allowed users to

extension had acquired over its lifetime is visible next to the star rating in
Figure 7. A labeled example of a map created by the
me as an avid user of Facebook Messenger. The post highlighted the fact that
the Facebook Messenger App transmits geo-locations alongside many of the
messages sent from mobile devices. The post went on to describe how the
Marauder's Map extension aggregates this data onto a map. It noted that at
least on Android devices the default setting for Messenger sends geo-location
with messages. The blog also provided some examples from using the extension
including how a person's geo-location can accumulate over time to reveal travel
On May 26 2015 I published the blog post and corresponding
code on Medium.com. [18] I also posted URL links to the blog post and extension
to both Reddit (reddit.com/r/privacy) [19] a popular forum for discussions on
data privacy and Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) [20] a popular technical
forum. Medium Reddit and Hacker News all have a voting system so that the
most interesting articles are voted (or recommended) upwards to the top
listings. Finally using my public Twitter handle (@arankhanna) I sent out a
tweet [21] asking my followers consisting mainly of family and friends to
This study used as one measure of public concern over
Facebook Messenger's sharing of geo-location data the popularity ranking of my
posts on the three sites. If the public response to the posts was indifferent
then the ratings would likely not increase on these forums. This study also
examined the quantity of news coverage received and the total number of
downloads of the extension as other measures of public concern. Finally the
study examined Facebook's response to any public concern.
News of the blog went viral starting within 24 hours of
posting and continuing for about 72 hours afterwards.
For the first 12 hours of posting little happened. The
Reddit post received 7 upvotes the Hacker News link also received 7 upvotes
and the Medium story had 3 recommendations by the end of the day. By the
morning of the 27th the story gained momentum on Twitter. Figures 8 and 9 show
the Twitter responses to my posts over the week after I initially posted the
blog. A total of 611 tweets and retweets reached a total follower audience of

The measure of reach is the number of followers the tweets

tweeted about the post and promoted it on its site. The tweets from the largest
influencers (those with over 10k followers) are labeled.
The increased traffic to my posts raised their rankings. For
example my post on Medium became the most recommended story of the day. Posts
linking to my blog and extension on both Hacker News and Reddit Privacy rose to
the front page of both by 8 a.m. PST. By 9 a.m. PST tech bloggers and content
aggregators including The Next Web Computerworld and The
Huffington Post covered the story in their blog posts and articles. The
Huffington Post asked to directly cross-publish my Medium blog post on its
site. Afterward information about my posts spread to Al Jazeera The
International Business Times and other major news organizations.

By the 28th only two days after my original posting news
stories about my posts appeared on CNN The Guardian The
Washington Post and many large international European Australian and Brazilian
publications (e.g. La Stampa Der Standard Globo NDTV
The Sydney Herald). By the 28th large TV networks such as CNBC

There have been more than 85000 downloads of the Chrome
extension since its release (Figure 6). Users continued to download the
extension even after I deactivated it in response to Facebook's request as described
The afternoon of the 27th one day after the Medium blog
post's publication Facebook contacted me. My future manager phoned and asked
me not to speak to any press; however I was told that I could keep my blog post
up. By that evening the global communications lead for privacy and public
policy at Facebook called me to clarify Facebook's expectations that I not
speak to the press saying that his objective was to hamper the spread of what
By midday of the 28th the global communications lead for
privacy and public policy at Facebook requested by email that I disable the
extension. I complied within the hour by deactivating the Mapbox API key
associated with the extension so that all current and future users could no
longer load the map used to display geo-location data.
On the morning of the 29th three days after my initial
posts media reported that my Chrome extension was turned off and no longer viable.
Additionally Facebook had tweaked its code to remove location data from
browsers. This alteration did not change Facebook's policy of collecting and
sharing geo-location data by default from the Facebook Messenger app on Android
and with user permission on iOS. However Facebook no longer transmitted this
location data to browsers. This action merely halted the use of an extension
such as mine that uses browser data. Geo-locations remained visible on the
Facebook Messenger mobile application and seemingly the map could be rebuilt
On the afternoon of the 29th three days after my initial
posts Facebook phoned me to inform me that it was rescinding the offer of a
summer internship citing as a reason that the extension violated the Facebook
user agreement by ""scraping"" the site. The head of global human resources and recruiting
followed up with an email message stating that my blog post did not reflect the
""high ethical standards"" around user privacy expected of interns. According to
the email the privacy issue was not with Facebook Messenger but rather with
my blog post and code describing how Facebook collected and shared users'
On June 4 nine days after my original posts Facebook
officially announced a Messenger update with a new feature requiring users to opt
into sharing their location during chats. Sharing would no longer be the
default. The press release did not mention the previous default settings for
geo-location data and did not disclose with whom Facebook would share the
previously collected data. [22] As of June 2015 shared geo-location data from
before the update remains viewable on the mobile application and users who did
not update to the new versions of the Messenger app on iOS and Android still
DiscussionAt the beginning of the study historical behavior by
Facebook and its users suggested that there might not be significant public
concern about Facebook Messenger's sharing of geo-location data. Even though
the media had highlighted the issue four years earlier Facebook had not been
concerned enough to make any fundamental change to its software. So why the
What seems to have made the difference was transparency. It
is possible that before my extension and blog post the degree of location data
collection and sharing by Facebook Messenger was hard for an average user to
notice and thus did not raise significant concern. Without public pressure
Facebook may have lacked significant incentive to change. My extension and blog
post made the data collection and sharing practice real and transparent. The
resulting public attention with over 85000 downloads of my tool more than
170 news articles and 3.6 million Twitter users exposed to my posts through
tweets and retweets seemed to motivate Facebook to react.
What does this say about privacy protection? Can we
reasonably expect Facebook or others with an interest in collecting and sharing
personal data to be responsible guardians of privacy? Could this work have
been done inside Facebook to understand how its users view the collection and
Must future privacy guardians always be on the outside?

Feel free to provide ideas for next steps follow-on research or other research inspired by this paper.
Perhaps someone will read your comment do the described work and publish a paper about it.
What do you recommend as a next research step? Suggestion 1How does Facebook's Privacy Policy or Facebook's License Agreement for the app at the time match these changes in Facebook Messenger's default on sharing personal geolocation? How do these compare with other apps that share personal geolocation data with other users? [Editors] Suggestion 2The demonstration code in this paper used the browser. Is the same information still available if you wrote code that could access the information that would be delivered to a mobile phone? [Editors] Suggestion 3Which news outlets were critical in spreading the word? Have these information flows been instrumental in possibly influencing other technology changes? [Editors] Suggestion 4I would like to see some ethnographic studies that elucidate the depth of understanding of this issue by the ""common man."" How is privacy understood by older or less tech savvy individuals? How likely are these people to be aware of these issues? What protections should exist for those who are not knowledgeable enough to protect themselves? Suggestion 5Interview with Apple's Tim Cook and get on his privacy/secyurity team!
(And thanks for the important difference you've already made.)
Continued Good Luck on your career! Suggestion 6Maybe this was a feature in messenger not a flaw. Maybe opt-out rather than opt-in made for a better user experience. I would like to see a study about utility. Did users like it better the other way? Or are users indifferent to the change? Is anyone complaining about the change? Your paper suggests that the media coverage made a difference. Is the media response a good proxy for how users feel? Suggestion 7Excellent analysis of the information dissemination through various channels Aran! I would like to see more studies that track information dissemination.
What are good ways to collect that data? Suggestion 8First of all thank you for your great work. I would like to see more studies about privacy awareness in people. What will make people act? What makes companies act? Suggestion 9Remember the Golden Rule: He with the Gold makes the rules.
Being correct and right in the context of an angry employer... ramifications.
I would like to know whether an employee can ever really do this kind of work effectively? Suggestion 10I would like to see a study of whistle blower laws. Maybe they need to be beefed up. Suggestion 11It's not just FACEBOOK that's doing this. I would like to see a study of geolocation sharing across apps. Suggestion 12This is a brilliant study and exposes the lack of privacy concerns by companies like Facebook which pay little more than lip service to an issue that most Internet users care about deeply. I'm sure Facebook felt its collective ""face"" flush over the embarrassment of this got indignant and revoked the student's internship. Instead the company should have hired him on the spot. A company that exalts itself as encouraging hacking culture as Facebook does would have been a good candidate to have hired him but they did not. I would like to see a study about corporate structures and cultures to better understand the internal pressures that lead to this outcome which seems typical. Suggestion 13Question: Did the author Mr.Khanna consult his supervisor before publishing the tool? Did he even know who his Facebook supervisor might be? He did this work while he was still at school and before the summer internship started. Mr. Khanna said he promptly complied with Facebook instructions to stop the demo.
I would like a study about the role and responsibilities of summer interns who do research at school and who are employees for a summer. How does this work? Can only students who will never do research related to a company be hired by the company? Should students who want to be hired never do this kind of research?
It seems optimal to have students interested in doing this kind of work actually being hired by these companies. Is that possible? Suggestion 14Excellent work. I would like to vote up Suggestion 4. I am quite common with zero tech savvy. Yet even I can recognize the implications of hacking and tracking personal devices without the user's knowledge and my concern is dismissed by most as paranoia. I would love to know what the tipping point might be for people. We love our wired world and we have willingly put on blinders when are we forced to look and know? Suggestion 15I write this not to thank Mr. Khanna. If the number of people who tweeted is in millions then the number of passive people would probably be at least 10 times. I was surprised by the fact that geolocation pin points to within a meter. That's scary. I would like a study that tracks how much of a person's time is captured in someone's geo-location database.
If I carry my mobile phone with me all the time then how often does some database somewhere know where I am? Suggestion 16Very interesting. It would be interesting too to know how many times similar historical private information's (like users position calls messages etc.) have been accessed after creation dates from what location read only or modified moved to another category/location etc. The metadata of archived files for alpha individuals and for beta groups (e.g. by interests age location incomes) can provide many details. An analyze from this reversed point of view of how the databases in question are used further by their owners could reveal their objects of interest (not really connected with targeted advertising) as well as lots of details about the interested persons behind. Suggestion 17It would be interesting to learn how much is known by vulnerable populations about about default location sharing of Facebook and other apps.
Victims of domestic violence jurors and police are examples of populations that may be vulnerable in different ways. Suggestion 18If only facebook itself views my geo location it wouldn't be an issue for me. But if others can see it then it is. I would like to see a survey of personal attitudes towards geolocation sharing. Suggestion 19When Facebook started selling mobile ads in 2012 not even the keenest optimists could have predicted how big a success they would become. In each of the past ten quarters mobile ads have accounted for more then 90% of Facebook's revenue growth. In the first six months of 2015 all of the company's growth came from advertising on tablets and smartphones. Mobile ad revenue now accounts for 76 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue and 72 percent of total revenue. I would be interested to know the role of geo-tagging in FB`s revenues as stated above. If all users disabled their geo-tagging what will be the impact on FB to sell customized ads. Suggestion 20I cannot find out ""Is geo-location so important to be used by applications"". I mean it should be an option like ""What's App"" gives share your location  only with those we want to share and not by default with all. Pin-point accurate geo-location is not necessary rather only the region from which the user is online is sufficient to share. I appreciate the way Mr. Aran did the whole analysis and presentation systematically. Big companies should take care of their users who blindly believe and uses their applications and should seek prior permission before collection and share of user's data about location. I would like to see a study to know if more gross geo-location reporting would work as well in many apps that use geo-location. Suggestion 21I see that you do not cite names from Facebook which understandably is in keeping with most academic guidelines and with most human subject considerations. Everything should be documented and if applicable in writing such as your internship. The fact your paper does not give names of specific people does not hold them accountable for thier actions and makes investigations much harder. I would have had a signed legal internship document before I moved. I would like to see among other things an ethongraphic study that interviews employees and includes those involved. For that I assume if researchers contact you that you will share the names of the people.
Suggestion 22Found your site on Google. This is a cool post. I'd like to see you take the main idea from this article and carete another second experiment and maybe you could embed a vid also? Suggestion 23Read this article because of my school assignment. Do we still have privacy? Thank you for educating people and making me aware of everything that is happening now.

pri_250_db,harvard students facebook data gathered and shared.txt,"Harvard's Privacy Meltdown - The Chronicle of Higher Education
Harvard Researchers Accused of Breaching Students' Privacy
Social-network project shows promise and peril of doing social science online
Jason Kaufman of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society says critics of his research on student Facebook profiles are acting like ""academic paparazzi.""
In 2006 Harvard sociologists struck a mother lode of social-science data offering a new way to answer big questions about how race and cultural tastes affect relationships.
The source: some 1700 Facebook profiles downloaded from an entire class of students at an ""anonymous"" university that could reveal how friendships and interests evolve over time.
It was the kind of collection that hundreds of scholars would find interesting. And in 2008 the Harvard team began to realize that potential by publicly releasing part of its archive.
But today the data-sharing venture has collapsed. The Facebook archive is more like plutonium than goldits contents yanked offline its future release uncertain its creators scolded by some scholars for downloading the profiles without students' knowledge and for failing to protect their privacy. Those students have been identified as Harvard College's Class of 2009.
The story of that collapse shines a light on emerging ethical challenges faced by scholars researching social networks and other online environments.
The Harvard sociologists argue that the data pulled from students' Facebook profiles could lead to great scientific benefits and that substantial efforts have been made to protect the students. Jason Kaufman the project's principal investigator and a research fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society points out that data were redacted to minimize the risk of identification. No student seems to have suffered any harm. Mr. Kaufman accuses his critics of acting like ""academic paparazzi.""
Adding to the complications researchers like Mr. Kaufman are being asked to safeguard privacy in an era when grant-making agencies increasingly request that data be sharedas the National Science Foundation did as a condition for backing Harvard's Facebook study.
The Facebook project began to unravel in 2008 when a privacy scholar at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee Michael Zimmer showed that the ""anonymous"" data of Mr. Kaufman and his colleagues could be cracked to identify the source as Harvard undergraduates.
""The steps that they tried to take to engage in innovative research to me fell short"" says Mr. Zimmer an assistant professor at Milwaukee's School of Information Studies and co-director of its Center for Information Policy Research. ""It just shows that we have a lot of work to do to make sure that we're doing this kind of research correctly and in ways that don't jeopardize the subjects that we're studying.""
The controversy over the Harvard data set known as ""Tastes Ties and Time"" comes amid growing interest in social-network research across disciplines including sociology communications history geography linguistics business computer science and psychology. The daily minutiae of our digital lives are so culturally valuable that the Library of Congress is on the eve of opening a research archive of public tweets.
""If you had to dream of research content it would be sending out a diary and having people record their thoughts at the moment"" says Alex Halavais an associate professor of communications at Quinnipiac University and soon-to-be president of the Association of Internet Researchers. ""That's like a social scientist's wet dream right? And here it has kind of fallen on our lap these ephemeral recordings that we would not have otherwise gotten.""
But that boon brings new pitfalls. Researchers must navigate the shifting privacy standards of social networks and their users. And the committees set up to protect research subjectsinstitutional review boards or IRB'slack experience with Web-based research Mr. Zimmer says. Most tend to focus on evaluating biomedical studies or traditional survey-based social science. He has pointed to the Harvard case in urging the federal government to do more to educate IRB's about Web research.
The project at the center of this dispute dates to Facebook's younger days. Even then the Harvard-born network was on its way to conquering American higher education. In 2006 with clearance from Harvard's IRB and Facebook Mr. Kaufman's team began dipping into the profiles of one class to build a data archive for social-science research.
The researchers downloaded each student's gender home state major political views network of friends and romantic tastes. To determine race and ethnicity they examined photographs and club affiliations. They recorded who appeared in students' photo albums. And they culled cultural tastes like books music and movies (top film: Lord of the Rings).
The archive was built to feed a team of five sociologistsfour from Harvard one from the University of California at Los Angeleswhose research interests include culture race and public health. Their push to vacuum up so many Facebook profiles helped overcome a big obstacle to social-network research: getting enough data. Typically researchers conduct such studies through external surveys of social-network users Mr. Zimmer says. Or they'll do an ethnography of a smaller group. That means the available data can be soiled because of self-reporting biases and errors he says. Or it may not truly represent the population. Not only had Mr. Kaufman's team amassed an ample data set but they had improved it by collecting information from the same class over four years. The data as Mr. Kaufman puts it amount to ""a complete social universe.""
But here's where things get sketchy. Mr. Kaufman apparently used Harvard students as research assistants to download the data. That's important because they had access to profiles that students might have set to be visible to Harvard's Facebook network but not to the whole world Mr. Zimmer argues in a 2010 paper about the case published in Ethics and Information Technology. The assistants' potentially privileged access ""should have triggered an ethical concern over whether each student truly intended to have their profile data publicly visible and accessible for downloading"" Mr. Zimmer says in an e-mail.
In an interview Mr. Kaufman declined to discuss who helped collect the data. But the sociologist did concede in a videotaped 2008 Berkman talk that the assistants created ""an interesting wrinkle to this from a legal point of view.""
""We faced a dilemma as researchers"" Mr. Kaufman said on tape. ""What happens if a student has a privacy setting that says 'You can't see me unless you're my friend' and our undergraduate research assistant who is downloading the data is a friend of that person? Then can we include them in our data?""
He left that question unanswered at the time. But Mr. Kaufman talks openly about another controversial piece of his data gathering: Students were not informed of it. He discussed this with the institutional review board. Alerting students risked ""frightening people unnecessarily"" he says.
""We all agreed that it was not necessary either legally or ethically"" Mr. Kaufman says.
The Harvard case reflects how the Internet is changing the relationship between researchers and their subjects sometimes creating what Elizabeth A. Buchanan director of the Center for Applied Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Stout calls a ""strange distance"" between the two. Researchers may grab content posted online without interacting with the people who wrote it or considering them ""human subjects."" But they may be aggregating data that can be traced to individuals says Ms. Buchanan.
The fundamental question is how best to protect subjects she says ""and sometimes in Internet research ... those issues get muddled.""
For example Quinnipiac's Mr. Halavais did a Twitter study focused on protests surrounding the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh. But something unanticipated happened: Some people were arrested for using Twitter to help demonstrators evade police. After that one of the key people in the study deleted his Twitter account. What the subject didn't know was that researchers had collected his tweets in an archive and planned to publish papers about the data.
Mr. Halavais didn't seek approval from his review boardas he sees it studying Twitter is like studying newspapers. ""We did not predict that the very act of tweeting something might be considered a criminal offense"" he says. ""I don't think an IRB would have been able to predict that any better than we would.""
A rule of thumb holds that if an online community requires a password to enter then researchers must seek IRB approval to study its members. But some scholars go further Mr. Halavais says arguing that researchers should seek approval to study open publishing platforms like blogs and Twitter.
Attitudes toward privacy are also evolving among both researchers and companies. Fred Stutzman a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University who studies privacy in social networks used to harvest Facebook data that students made public on his university network. He isn't sure he'd do that today.
""This is the nature of these systems"" says Mr. Stutzman who has criticized the Library of Congress's Twitter project. ""Maybe in three years we'll look at public tweets and say Oh my God those weren't public. A lot of people that are using Twitter nowadays may actually want to go back and delete their accounts or take those things out of the public at a later date and they no longer can.""
Twitter recently alarmed researchers by saying that collecting tweets and making them openly available violates the terms of service a blow to academics who want to share data.
Facebook too has taken a stricter approach to research as the company has matured and weathered several privacy controversies. Cameron Marlow its head of data science and ""in-house sociologist"" has built up a small but tightly controlled program for external research since joining Facebook in 2007.
Asked about the Harvard sociologists' project Mr. Marlow says things would be different had it begun now: ""We would have been much more involved with the researchers who are doing the data collection.""
All work would be done on Facebook servers for example. And releasing data? Unlikely.
""We tend to not release any data for the fact that it's almost impossible to anonymize social-network data"" he says.
Mr. Zimmer proved him right. Within days of Harvard's release from the data archive he zeroed in on the institution without even downloading the profiles. Most of what he needed was in the archive's code booka lengthy document at the time easily available online (it has since been restricted) that described in detail how the data set was collected and what it contains. The size of the class uniquely titled majors like ""organismic and evolutionary biology"" and Harvard's particular housing system all clued Mr. Zimmer in to the source of the Facebook information.
Mr. Kaufman for his part won't comment on whether Harvard is in fact the source of his data.
But assuming that Mr. Zimmer is correct why does it matter? What's the danger?
One issue Mr. Zimmer says is that someone might be able to figure out individual students' identities. People with unique characteristics could be discovered on the basis of what the Harvard group published about them. (For example the original code book lists just three students from Utah.) Their information could be absorbed by online aggregators like Pipl. A prospective employer might Google a student and use the resulting information to discriminate against him or her Mr. Zimmer says.
""These bits and pieces of our personal identities could potentially have reputational harm"" he says.
He's right about how easy it is to identify people who are presumably part of the data set. By searching a Facebook group of Harvard's Class of 2009 a Chronicle reporter quickly tracked down one of those three Utah students. Her name is Sarah M. Ashburn. The 24-year-old is in Haiti working for a foundation that helps AIDS victims.
The Facebook-data controversy was news to her. In a telephone interview Ms. Ashburn says her main qualm with the project is its use of students who may have had privileged access to data that was supposed to be shared only with friends or friends of friends. Because of that she feels that the researchers should have informed the class about their project.
Still she isn't concerned about the possibility that her own data is out there.
""Anything that's put on Facebook somehow will make it out into the general public no matter what you attempt to do"" she says. ""So I never have anything on my Facebook profile that I wouldn't want employers my grandmother like anyone in the world to be able to see.""
In their defense the Harvard sociologists stress that researchers outside their own group had to apply for access to download the data and agree not to share it or identify people within it. Distribution was halted immediately after privacy concerns were raised says Kevin Lewis a Ph.D. candidate who is part of the research team. By that time he says fewer than 20 researchers had access. Each presumably still has a copy.
After the initial release the researchers took additional steps to protect the students' identities. For example a revised code book substituted general regions like ""mountain"" and ""Pacific"" for students' home states and general major categories like ""humanities"" and ""life sciences"" for their academic backgrounds.
As for the criticism of Harvard's institutional review board the university seems to agree on the need for greater guidance. A spokesman Jeff A. Neal notes that ""current federal human-subjects regulations were written well before the Internet age and there is still little published guidance for IRB's on the implications of new and emerging technologies and potential risks."" He adds ""Federal regulators professional associations and IRB's are all working to understand these risks and to develop guidelines.""
The biggest victim in this case may be scholarship.
The controversy has tainted Harvard's data. And ""once a data set has been clearly de-anonymized it becomes a little bit like kryptonite"" says Mr. Halavais. ""People will touch it but you're putting your own ethical stance at risk if you do.""
There may never be another chance to touch it. The Harvard sociologists are still using the data for their own research. But they haven't settled on a secure way of publicly sharing it again.
Since the public release ceased in 2008 Mr. Lewis has received more than 200 requests for the data from researchers. He still gets one or two inquiries each week.

Sony Got Hacked Hard: What We Know and Dont Know So Far
A photo of a screen showing what is apparently the skull splash page that appeared on Sony company computers when the attack started posted by someone who said he was a former Sony employee who was sent the image by current Sony employees. The image was first posted on Reddit.
Editors note 2:30 p.m. ET 12/04/14: After further reporting we have updated the sections How Did This Hack Occur? and Was Data Destroyed or Just Stolen? with new information about the nature of the attack and malware used in it.
Who knew that Sonys top brass a line-up of mostly white male executives earn $1 million and more a year? Or that the company spent half a million this year in severance costs to terminate employees? Now we all do since about 40 gigabytes of sensitive company data from computers belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment were stolen and posted online.
As so often happens with breach stories the more time that passes the more we learn about the nature of the hack the data that was stolen and sometimes even the identity of the culprits behind it. A week into the Sony hack however there is a lot of rampant speculation but few solid facts. Heres a look at what we do and dont know about whats turning out to be the biggest hack of the yearand who knows maybe of all time.
Most of the headlines around the Sony hack havent been about what was stolen but rather whos behind it. A group calling itself GOP or Guardians of Peace has taken responsibility. But who they are is unclear. The media seized on a comment made to one reporter by an anonymous source that North Korea might be behind the hack. The motive? Retaliation for Sonys yet-to-be-released film The Interview a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy about an ill-conceived CIA plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
James Franco and Seth Rogen in a scene from The Interview.
If that sounds outlandish thats because it likely is. The focus on North Korea is weak and easily undercut by the facts. Nation-state attacks dont usually announce themselves with a showy image of a blazing skeleton posted to infected machines or use a catchy nom-de-hack like Guardians of Peace to identify themselves. Nation-state attackers also generally dont chastise their victims for having poor security as purported members of Guardians of Peace have done in media interviews.
Nor do such attacks result in posts of stolen data to Pastebinthe unofficial cloud repository of hackers everywherewhere sensitive company files purportedly belonging to Sony were leaked this week.
Weve been here before with nation-state attributions. Anonymous sources told Bloomberg earlier this year that investigators were looking at the Russian government as the possible culprit behind a hack of JP Morgan Chase. The possible motive in that case was retaliation for sanctions against the Kremlin over military actions against Ukraine. Bloomberg eventually walked back from the story to admit that cybercriminals were more likely the culprits. And in 2012 U.S. officials blamed Iran for an attack called Shamoon that erased data on thousands of computers at Saudi Aramco Saudi Arabias national oil company. No proof was offered to back the claim but glitches in the malware used for the attack showed it was less likely a sophisticated nation-state attack than a hacktivist assault against the oil conglomerates policies.
The likely culprits behind the Sony breach are hacktivistsor disgruntled insidersangry at the companys unspecified policies. One media interview with a person identified as a member of Guardians of Peace hinted that a sympathetic insider or insiders aided them in their operation and that they were seeking equality. The exact nature of their complaints about Sony are unclear though the attackers accused Sony of greedy and criminal business practices in interviews without elaborating.
Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City Calif. on December 2 2014.
Similarly in a cryptic note posted by Guardians of Peace on hacked Sony machines the attackers indicated that Sony had failed to meet their demands but didnt indicate the nature of those demands. Weve already warned you and this is just the beginning. We continue till our request be met.
One of the purported hackers with the group told CSO Online that they are an international organization including famous figures in the politics and society from several nations such as United States United Kingdom and France. We are not under direction of any state.
The person said the Seth Rogen film was not the motive for the hack but that the film is problematic nonetheless in that it exemplifies Sonys greed. This shows how dangerous film The Interview is the person told the publication. The Interview is very dangerous enough to cause a massive hack attack. Sony Pictures produced the film harming the regional peace and security and violating human rights for money. The news with The Interview fully acquaints us with the crimes of Sony Pictures. Like this their activity is contrary to our philosophy. We struggle to fight against such greed of Sony Pictures.
Its unclear when the hack began. One interview with someone claiming to be with Guardians for Peace said they had been siphoning data from Sony for a year. Last Monday Sony workers became aware of the breach after an image of a red skull suddenly appeared on screens company-wide with a warning that Sonys secrets were about to be spilled. Sonys Twitter accounts were also seized by the hackers who posted an image of Sony CEO Michael Lynton in hell.
News of the hack first went public when someone purporting to be a former Sony employee posted a note on Reddit along with an image of the skull saying current employees at the company had told him their email systems were down and they had been told to go home because the companys networks had been hacked. Sony administrators reportedly shut down much of its worldwide network and disabled VPN connections and Wi-Fi access in an effort to control the intrusion.
This is still unclear. Most hacks like this begin with a phishing attack which involve sending emails to employees to get them to click on malicious attachments or visit web sites where malware is surreptitiously downloaded to their machines. Hackers also get into systems through vulnerabilities in a companys web site that can give them access to backend databases. Once on an infected system in a companys network hackers can map the network and steal administrator passwords to gain access to other protected systems on the network and hunt down sensitive data to steal.
New documents released by the attackers yesterday show the exact nature of the sensitive information they obtained to help them map and navigate Sonys internal networks. Among the more than 11000 newly-released files are hundreds of employee usernames and passwords as well as RSA SecurID tokens and certificates belonging to Sonywhich are used to authenticate users and systems at the companyand information detailing how to access staging and production database servers including a master asset list mapping the location of the companys databases and servers around the world. The documents also include a list of routers switches and load balancers and the usernames and passwords that administrators used to manage them.
All of this vividly underscores why Sony had to shut down its entire infrastructure after discovering the hack in order to re-architect and secure it.
The hackers claim to have stolen a huge trove of sensitive data from Sony possibly as large as 100 terabytes of data which they are slowly releasing in batches. Judging from data the hackers have leaked online so far this includes in addition to usernames passwords and sensitive information about its network architecture a host of documents exposing personal information about employees. The leaked documents include a list of employee salaries and bonuses; Social Security numbers and birth dates; HR employee performance reviews criminal background checks and termination records; correspondence about employee medical conditions; passport and visa information for Hollywood stars and crew who worked on Sony films; and internal email spools.
All of these leaks are embarrassing to Sony and harmful and embarrassing to employees. But more importantly for Sonys bottom line the stolen data also includes the script for an unreleased pilot by
Vince Gilligan the creator of Breaking Bad as well as full copies of several Sony films most of which have not been released in theaters yet. These include copies of the upcoming films Annie Still Alice and Mr. Turner. Notably no copy of the Seth Rogen flick has been part of the leaks so far.
Initial reports have focused only on the data stolen from Sony. But news of an FBI flash alert released to companies this week suggests that the attack on Sony might have included malware designed to destroy data on its systems.
The five-page FBI alert doesnt mention Sony but anonymous sources told Reuters that it appears to refer to malware used in the Sony hack. This correlates with information  that many of us in the security industry have been tracking one of the sources said. It looks exactly like information from the Sony attack.
The alert warns about malware capable of wiping data from systems in such an effective way as to make the data unrecoverable.
The FBI is providing the following information with HIGH confidence the note reads according to one person who received it and described it to WIRED. Destructive malware used by unknown computer network exploitation (CNE) operators has been identified. This malware has the capability to overwrite a victim hosts master boot record (MBR) and all data files. The overwriting of the data files will make it extremely difficult and costly if not impossible to recover the data using standard forensic methods.
The FBI memo lists the names of the malwares payload filesusbdrv3_32bit.sys and usbdrv3_64bit.sys.
WIRED spoke with a number of people about the hack and have confirmed that at least one of these payloads was found on Sony systems.
So far there have been no news reports indicating that data on the Sony machines was destroyed or that master boot records were overwritten. A Sony spokeswoman only indicated to Reuters that the company has restored a number of important services.
But Jaime Blasco director of labs at the security firm AlienVault examined samples of the malware and told WIRED it was designed to systematically search out specific servers at Sony and destroy data on them.
Blasco obtained four samples of the malware including one that was used in the Sony hack and was uploaded to the VirusTotal web site. His team found the other samples using the indicators of compromise aka IOC mentioned in the FBI alert. IOC are the familiar signatures of an attack that help security researchers discover infections on customer systems such as the IP address malware uses to communicate with command-and-control servers.
the sample uploaded to VirusTotal contains a hard-coded list that names 50 internal Sony computer systems based in the U.S. and the UK that the malware was attacking as well as log-in credentials it used to access them. The server names indicate the attackers had extensive knowledge of the companys architecture gleaned from the documents and other intelligence they siphoned. The other malware samples dont contain references to Sonys networks but do contain the same IP addresses the Sony hackers used for their command-and-control servers. Blasco notes that the file used in the Sony hack was compiled on November 22. Other files he examined were compiled on November 24 and back in July.
The sample with the Sony computer names in it was designed to systematically connect to each server on the list. It contains a user name and password and a list of internal systems and it connects to each of them and wipes the hard drives [and deletes the master boot record] says Blasco.
Notably to do the wiping the attackers used a driver from a commercially-available product designed to be used by system administrators for legitimate maintenance of systems. The product is called RawDisk and is made by Eldos. The driver is a kernel-mode driver used to securely delete data from hard drives or for forensic purposes to access memory.
The same product was used in similarly destructive attacks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The 2012 Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco
wiped data from about 30000 computers. A group calling itself the Cutting Sword of Justice took credit for the hack. This is a warning to the tyrants of this country and other countries that support such criminal disasters with injustice and oppression they wrote in a Pastebin post. We invite all anti-tyranny hacker groups all over the world to join this movement. We want them to support this movement by designing and performing such operations if they are against tyranny and oppression.
Then last year a similar attack struck computers at banks and media companies in South Korea. The attack used a logic bomb set to go off at a specific time that wiped computers in a coordinated fashion. The attack wiped the hard drives and master boot record of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously reportedly putting some ATMs out of operation and preventing South Koreans from withdrawing cash from them. South Korea initially blamed China for the attack but later retracted that allegation.
Blasco says theres no evidence that the same attackers behind the Sony breach were responsible for the attacks in Saudi Arabia or South Korea.
Probably its not the same attackers but just [a group that] replicated what other attackers did in the past he says.
All four of the files Blasco examined appear to have been compiled on a machine that was using the Korean languagewhich is one of the reasons people have pointed a finger at North Korea as the culprit behind the Sony attack. Essentially this refers to whats called the encoding language on a computercomputer users can set the encoding language on their system to the language they speak so content renders in their language.
The fact that the encoding language on the computer used to compile the malicious files appears to be Korean however is not a true indication of its source since an attacker can set the language to anything he wants and as Blasco points out can even manipulate information about the encoded language after a file is compiled.
I dont have any data that can tell me if North Korea is behind it  the only thing is the language but  its really easy to fake this data Blasco says.

pri_250_db,canadian teenager was raped and rapists distribute.txt,"Suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons - Wikipedia the free encyclopedia
The suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons was a Canadian incident reportedly related to sexual humiliation and bullying. Parsons(/rte./ r-TEY-[1]) a 17-year-old (December 9 1995  April 7 2013) former Cole Harbour District High School student attempted suicide by hanging[2] on April 4 2013 at her home in Dartmouth Nova Scotia Canada leading to a coma and the decision to switch her life support machine off on April 7 2013.[3] Her death has been attributed to online distribution of photos of an alleged gang rape that occurred 17 months prior to her suicide in November 2011.[3][4] On a Facebook page set up in tribute to her daughter Parsons' mother blamed the four boys who allegedly raped and released images of her the subsequent constant ""bullying and messaging and harassment"" and the failure of the Canadian justice system for her daughter's decision to commit suicide.[5]
In response to Parsons' suicide Nova Scotia enacted a law in August 2013 allowing victims to seek protection from cyberbullying and to sue the perpetrator.
In November 2011 Rehtaeh Parsons then 15 allegedly went with a friend to a home in which she was reportedly raped by four teenage boys.[6] The teenagers were drinking vodka at a small party. Parsons had little memory of the event except that at one point she vomited while a boy was allegedly raping her. The incident was photographed and the photo became widespread in Parsons' school and town in three days. Afterwards many in school called Parsons a ""slut"" and she received text messages and Facebook messages from people requesting to have sex with her. The alleged rape went unreported for several days until Parsons broke down and told her family who contacted an emergency health team and the police.[7]
According to an RCMP report in March 2013 six boys including some of Parsons' accused rapists had an angry argument with three other boys. One of the three boys who was a friend of Parsons was stabbed and treated for a ""non-life-threatening injury"".[8]
A year following the alleged rape the RCMP concluded an investigation stating ""[an] investigation into an earlier sexual assault was completed and in consultation with the Crown there was insufficient evidence to lay charges"".[3] According to the family the boys were not questioned and their phones were not reviewed for the photograph of the rape in progress.[9] Instead the police called it a ""he said she said"" case and also decided the photo was not criminal in spite of Parsons being a minor.[7] Likewise there were no arrests for the March 2013 stabbing incident.[8]
Following the suicide the RCMP announced they were reviewing the case.[10] On April 12 the RCMP announced the case was being reopened in light of ""new and credible information"" that they said did not come from the Internet.[11]
In September 2014 one of the boys by then 20 pled guilty to a charge of making child pornography in relation to the photo of Parsons.[12] Citing the offender's age at the time of the crime and Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act the Crown had advised the Judge that the only possible penalties in this case were either probation or a conditional discharge.[13] In November 2014 the first defendant to plead guilty was sentenced to a conditional discharge with 12 months' probation.[14] With a conditional discharge his criminal record will not show a conviction in this case unless he breaches the terms of his probation.
Also in November 2014 the second person charged then 19 pled guilty to a charge of distributing child pornography in relation to the photo of himself and Parsons.[15] He was sentenced on January 15 2015 to one year of probation and required to submit a sample to a DNA database.[16] In an unusual move for a case involving minors convicted of a crime the judge ruled that this conviction would be kept in his criminal record for a period of five years.[17]
Following the suicide Rehtaeh Parsons's mother Leah Parsons went public with the story and started a memorial Facebook page[7] called ""Angel Rehtaeh.""[2] The blog of Rehtaeh's father Glen Canning also went viral.[8] The story drew international attention and sparked outrage on the Internet with CBC reporting the phrase ""Nova Scotia"" was ""trending on Twitter worldwide.""[18]
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper commented on the case saying he was ""sickened"" by the story and that the online bullying was ""simply criminal activity.""[19] Rehtaeh's funeral on April 13 was attended by 500 people including Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter who said he came ""first and foremost as a father trying to imagine what kind of incredible unfathomable grief could be visited upon a family.""[20]
There are reports that members of the hacker group Anonymous involved itself in tracing the alleged perpetrators of the incidents Parsons suffered.[21] In its news release Anonymous blamed the death on ""school teachers administrators the police and prosecutors those who should have been role models in the late Rehtaeh's life.""[19] Later Anonymous announced it would not publicize the names of the individuals it believed to be the rapists in respect of the Parsons family's wishes.[22] Leah Parsons had called for the case to be settled legally rather than by vigilantes.[18]
Parsons' suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have been compared to those of British Columbian Amanda Todd[18][23] and with Audrie Pott a fifteen-year-old girl from Saratoga California United States and appear to show highly similar characteristics. New laws are being considered after these events.[24][25] Parsons has been described as a ""victim of sexting"".[5]
After her suicide posters appeared locally in support of the boys who allegedly attacked Parsons. The RCMP expressed concern that the posters might lead to vigilantism although they did not name the accused.[26]
On April 26 2013 Christie Blatchford wrote in the National Post that a problem in the case was that one of Parsons' friends claimed Parsons was ""flirtatious"" on the night the photo was taken was seen laughing in bed with two boys and also there were ""accounts from Rehtaeh herself and independent evidence including retrieved online messages that supported the suggestion the sex that took place was consensual."" Blatchford also wrote the photo did not show Parsons' face.[27] In response Parsons' father Glen Canning accused Blatchford of victim blaming and argued ""The two boys involved in taking and posing for the photograph stated Rehtaeh was throwing up when they had sex with her. That is not called consensual sex. That is called rape.""[28]
In August 2013 Nova Scotia enacted a law allowing victims of cyberbullying to seek protection including help in identifying anonymous perpetrators and to sue the individuals or the parents in the case of minors. The law was passed in response to Parsons' suicide.[29][30]
Canadian media reports about criminal trials involving child pornography are subject to a publication ban under the Criminal Code: they must omit any information that would identify any minor who was involved in or witness to the case including the victim or be subject to fines. In November 2014 the Halifax Chronicle Herald violated the ban by publishing the name and photo of Parsons on its front page and online; the story was accompanied by an editor's note stating: ""We've decided to publish the name of the victim in this story despite a court-ordered ban. We believe it's in the public interest in this unique case given the widespread recognition of [her] name and given the good that can come and has already come from free public debate over sexual consent and the other elements of her story."" Noting that her name and photo had been widely disseminated prior to the trial both the victim's parents and the trial's judge objected to the ban. The Chronicle Herald became the subject of investigation for its actions following complaints by police although other media outlets have been investigated in Halifax for violating the ban but have not been subject to any charges.[31]
In December 2014 Nova Scotia's attorney general announced that she was directing the province's Public Prosecution Service to only pursue breaches of the publication ban in Parsons' case if the breach is derogatory of Rehtaeh Parsons. The ban remains technically in place but unbiased reports about the case will not be subject to prosecution.[32]

pri_250_db,a british legal ruling bars media outlets from pub.txt,"Free Speech and Privacy Rights Collide on Twitter - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
SAN FRANCISCO  What began as seamy gossip about an affair between a famous British soccer player and a reality TV star has quickly become another test over how far the rights to privacy and free speech extend online where social media operate in countries with vastly different laws.
The soccer player has been granted a so-called super-injunction a stringent and controversial British legal measure that prevents media outlets from identifying him reporting on the story or even from revealing the existence of the court order itself.But tens of thousands of Internet users have flouted the injunction by revealing his name on Twitter Facebook and online soccer forums sites that blur the definition of the press and are virtually impossible to police.Last week amid growing outrage in Britain over the use of super-injunctions the athlete obtained a court order in British High Court demanding that Twitter reveal the identities of the anonymous users who had posted the messages. A Twitter spokesman Matt Graves said the company could not comment on the court order or how it planned to respond.Eric Goldman director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University said Its really going to the core of Twitters service and trying to balance the speech of its users and the fact that countries have different laws and norms about speech.And while a debate centering on an athletes love life might not seem to be the most pressing example of free speech online there are broader and more urgent implications analysts said.If you step back that same sort of protection is really vital to have in place when youre talking about the individuals involved in a revolution or a social movement like the Arab Spring said Thomas R. Burke a chairman of the media law practice at the firm Davis Wright Tremaine.In a company blog post in January Biz Stone a Twitter founder and Alex Macgillivray its general counsel wrote Our position on freedom of expression carries with it a mandate to protect our users right to speak freely and preserve their ability to contest having their private information revealed.Twitter removes spam and illegal posts they wrote but tries to limit those exceptions. It releases information when required by law but notifies users before the disclosures unless it is legally prohibited from doing so.Because Twitter is based in the United States it could argue that it abides by the law and that any plaintiff would need to try the case in the United States legal analysts said. But Twitter is opening a London office and the rules are more complicated if companies have employees or offices in foreign countries.Still Twitter has resisted turning over this type of information in the past. Mr. Macgillivray when asked about international laws at a conference in March said We tell them were a U.S. company we have C.D.A. 230 here and youre welcome to come and try your hand at suing us here referring to the Communications Decency Act which says Web companies are not liable for what their users post.
There is no question that the Twitter posts about the soccer player would be considered legal in the United States Internet law experts said because of the Communications Decency Act and the First Amendments protections for anonymous speech. Further an injunction to prevent this type of information from being exposed would be unheard of in the United States. But the issue gets murkier across borders.You would think at this point in the Internet you would have a clear body of law about what laws the Internet is subject to but that is anything but clear Mr. Burke said.Other American Internet companies have run up against conflicting international laws. When Google opened its search engine in China it censored results in accordance with Chinese law and it has faced legal issues in Germany over the use of photographs taken for its Street View maps.Web sites where users post content grapple with different restrictions. Some companies handle the issue by opening localized sites that sometimes follow different rules. Yelp and eBay for instance operate different sites in different countries.In Britain super-injunctions have been hotly debated. Many Britons are outraged that celebrities enmeshed in scandals and businesses engaged in dubious practices have received the injunctions with little oversight.The controversy over the soccer player escalated over the weekend when Internet users  chafing at the injunction and what they perceived as its restriction on free speech  repeatedly posted his name online.Once the information is online the injunction is futile both critics and supporters of super-injunctions argue. For instance the soccer players name is now so widely known that it has become a running joke discussed  with the name bleeped out  on prime-time television. Foreign publications like Forbes.com and The Sunday Herald a Scottish paper have printed his name.Jeremy Hunt the British culture secretary said at a forum last week that the Internet was making a mockery of the injunctions. We have this very unfortunate and unsustainable situation where newspapers cant print things that are freely available on the Internet he said.But there is support as well for the way British law tries to protect privacy. Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge Britains most senior judge said in a report issued Friday that people who flout injunctions online could be liable.Are we really going to say he asked that somebody who has a true claim for privacy perfectly well made which the newspapers and media cant report has to be at the mercy of somebody using modern technology?But Charlotte Harris a media lawyer who has represented both public figures seeking injunctions and people arguing against injunctions said that could be extremely difficult.When you sign up to most sites you agree to terms and conditions that say you wont use them to break the law she said. The problem is that its all so difficult to enforce. Where would you begin?

pri_250_db,it's discovered that microsoft scans skype message.txt,"Think your Skype messages get end-to-end encryption? Think again | Ars Technica
Think your Skype messages get end-to-end encryption? Think again
Ars catches Microsoft accessing links we sent in our test messages.
If you think the private messages you send over Skype are protected by end-to-end encryption think again. The Microsoft-owned service regularly scans message contents for signs of fraud and company managers may log the results indefinitely Ars has confirmed. And this can only happen if Microsoft can convert the messages into human-readable form at will.
With the help of independent privacy and security researcher Ashkan Soltani Ars used Skype to send four Web links that were created solely for purposes of this article. Two of them were never clicked on but the other twoone beginning in HTTP link and the other HTTPSwere accessed by a machine at 65.52.100.214 an IP address belonging to Microsoft. For those interested in the technical details the log line looked like this:
'65.52.100.214 - - [16/May/2013 11:30:10] ""HEAD /index.html?test_never_clicked HTTP/1.1"" 200 -'
The resultswhich were similar but not identical to those reported last week by The H Securityprove conclusively that Microsoft not only has ability to peer at the plaintext sent from one Skype user to another but that the company regularly flexes that monitoring muscle.
In one sense this shouldn't come as news. Skype's privacy policy clearly states that it may (emphasis added) use automated scanning within Instant Messages and SMS to identify spam and links to sites engaged in phishing and other forms of fraud. And as Ars reported last year since Skype was acquired by Microsoft the network running the service has been drastically overhauled from its design of the preceding decade. Gone are the peer-to-peer ""supernodes"" made up of users with sufficient amounts of bandwidth and processing power; in their place are some 10000 Linux machines hosted by Microsoft. In short the decentralization that had been one of Skype's hallmarks was replaced with a much more centralized network. It stands to reason that messages traveling over centralized networks may be easier to monitor.
Still there's a widely held beliefeven among security professionals journalists and human rights activiststhat Skype somehow offers end-to-end encryption meaning communications are encrypted by one user transmitted over the wire and then decrypted only when they reach the other party and are fully under that party's control. This is clearly not the case if Microsoft has the ability to read URLs transmitted back and forth.
""The problem right now is that there's a mismatch between the privacy people expect and what Microsoft is actually delivering"" Matt Green a professor specializing in encryption at Johns Hopkins University told Ars. ""Even if Microsoft is only scanning links for 'good' purposes say detecting malicious URLs this indicates that they can intercept some of your text messages. And that means they could potentially intercept a lot more of them.""
Specifics of the Microsoft scanning remain unclear; one possibility is that the scanning and spam-checking happen on Microsoft servers as communications pass through supernodes. Another possibility is that the Skype client on each end-user machine uses ""regular expression"" programming techniques built into the software and sends only the links to Microsoft servers.
""Either way the finding does confirm that somewhere along the stream Microsoft/Skype has the ability to intercept/extract content from your communications though we can't conclusively say where"" Soltani wrote in an e-mail to Ars. ""For example even if the scanning was happening client side it's plausible that MS could be compelled to push a ruleset to the Skype client that just logs/transmits all our activity (similar to what CarrierIQ was doing
Helping to feed this confusion about exactly what measures are taken to protect Skype messages is Microsoft's management which remains vague about the precise type of encryption its service uses. Asked for comment on this story a spokeswoman offered a statement that was identical to a single sentence in the privacy policy. The statement didn't address my other question that's equally important: does Microsoft record the links and other content sent over Skype? Eventually I found the answer and unfortunately it gives Microsoft all the wiggle room it needs. It states: ""Skype will retain your information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfill any of the Purposes (as defined in article 2 of this Privacy Policy) or (2) comply with applicable legislation regulatory requests and relevant orders from competent courts.""
To be fair Microsoft's scanning of Skype messages isn't too different from techniques Facebook reportedly employs and what any number of other online services do too. As Green notes these companies have a duty to make sure their services aren't abused to circulate malware.
What's different in the case of Skype is the misunderstanding among many users that links and other content sent over the service are private. This misunderstanding is all the more unfortunate given the possibility that this information plucked out of private messages could be logged and retained for as long as some nameless faceless Microsoft manager deems appropriate. Add to that the fact that a server bearing a Microsoft IP address very well may click on any link you send over Skype and it may not be such a good option for dissidents trying to lay low.
So the next time you use Skype enjoy the clarity of the voice communications its generally slick user interface and its many other benefits. Just don't think the service can't peer into your messages and store indefinitely what Microsoft managers want. It can and until officials specifically disclose their practices users should assume it does.
bilyl wrote:The difference is that Skype is secure against a malicious hacker down the street. It is *not* secure against Microsoft and the Feds. For some people that's good enough. For others they'll probably have to look elsewhere. I think this is an issue that needs to be made public so people can vote with their feet.That's misleading. Either something is secure or it's not and
Skype is not. Even if you trust MS and the Feds the fact that they can decrypt the communications means that anyone that compromises a Skype server can do it also.
We're well past the point where the only hackers are kids doing it for kicks there would be a lot of money in silently compromising a server like that and selling the captured info.If you need security you need to control both endpoints. having the server be an endpoint is never going to be secure.
fuzzyfuzzyfungus wrote:Solomonoff's Secret wrote:fuzzyfuzzyfungus wrote:I have to wonder what brave admin at MS is responsible for handling the machines that follow links in Skype traffic...Just imagine: ""So your job is to run some servers. They will programmatically visit any arbitrary URL that any Skype user wishes to feed them. Have a nice day and try not to get compromised.""If you issue a HTTP GET from your favorite programming language there isn't much risk of a browser exploit working. I'm pretty damn sure MS doesn't script Internet Explorer to visit all those pages.Presumably if they are looking for phishing/malware/etc. they have to be running something of reasonable complexity against the payload. Just poking the server and getting a 'yup it's here!' would indeed be fairly safe; but also entirely pointless. They have to be running some sort of AV system or something for the system to be worth operating at all.As shown in the log file snippet included in the article the HTTP GET request was not issued; they sent a HEAD request which does not retrieve page content. From section 9.4 of the HTML 1.1 spec:Quote:The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. (emphasis mine).The HEAD request is used for checking if a file or object exists at all checking its size etc. - meta stuff.As for Microsoft's/Skype's methodology my first bet was as others have mentioned the client checking links for phishing or other malicious addresses just as a browser does. However the questions (mysteries!) there are why it would actually check the link by issuing the HEAD request which proves very little as it it would ""catch"" temporary network issues or server outages etc. Useless for security. And also why it comes from a Microsoft address not the client's address. Browser ""safe browsing"" features typically involve DNS requests and requests sent to a safe-browsing service's network such as Google's safe browsing look-up service from the client. The Microsoft source address has other implications in my opinion.
pusher robot wrote:I might be missing something but it doesn't seem to me that the test performed can possibly lead to the conclusion that end-to-end encryption definitely does not exist as suggested by the headline.
The article itself raises the possibility of the following scenario:1. Message encrypted by ""A"" such that only ""B"" can decrypt it.2. Message is passed from ""A"" to ""B"" without being decrypted.3. Message is decrypted by ""B""'s local client.4. ""B""'s local client parses internet URLs and sends them to Microsoft's SmartScreen filter.5. Microsoft's SmartScreen service checks the existence of the URL and/or does some follow-up reports back to the client.Now I'm not saying I know that this is what is happening.
In fact I kind of doubt it just because it would be more efficient (especially for group communications) to manage encryption from client to server only.
But would this not would show the results presented in this article while still being end-to-end encryption?
How can you rule out this scenario from this test?Is there any meaningful difference between ""message is encrypted by A sent to MS's servers decrypted stored re-encrypted and forwarded to B"" and ""message is encrypted by A sent to B decrypted by B forwarded to MS's servers and stored""?Either way MS's servers still have a theoretically-permanent copy of the message that A sent to B; either way Skype is not functionally offering end-to-end encryption; either way Skype is not as secure as the article suggests most people believe it to be.
minnmass wrote:Is there any meaningful difference between ""message is encrypted by A sent to MS's servers decrypted stored re-encrypted and forwarded to B"" and ""message is encrypted by A sent to B decrypted by B forwarded to MS's servers and stored""? The functional difference would be that a MITM attack which modified the message before being received by B would be impossible.However as Xavin points out a Skype server being compromised in order to snoop on the plain-text info would still be in play.
Also in the scenario proposed by pusher-robot would this not open up the recipient's connection back to MS as another attack vector?

In fact I kind of doubt it just because it would be more efficient (especially for group communications) to manage encryption from client to server only.
But would this not would show the results presented in this article while still being end-to-end encryption?
How can you rule out this scenario from this test?Is there any meaningful difference between ""message is encrypted by A sent to MS's servers decrypted stored re-encrypted and forwarded to B"" and ""message is encrypted by A sent to B decrypted by B forwarded to MS's servers and stored""?Either way MS's servers still have a theoretically-permanent copy of the message that A sent to B; either way Skype is not functionally offering end-to-end encryption; either way Skype is not as secure as the article suggests most people believe it to be.In the latter case the client could theoretically be sending the URL's only not the complete message.
be a meaningful difference to me especially if you have already chosen to use the SmartScreen service.

The functional difference would be that a MITM attack which modified the message before being received by B would be impossible.However as Xavin points out a Skype server being compromised in order to snoop on the plain-text info would still be in play.
Also in the scenario proposed by pusher-robot would this not open up the recipient's connection back to MS as another attack vector?I see your point; I should have asked whether from a privacy perspective there was a meaningful difference. Modified messages while certainly not good don't have the privacy implications that the stored-indefinitely copies present.Clearly MitM is worse than ""B (or A) forwards copies to MS"" but they still both end with MS having a copy of the message.
pusher robot wrote:I might be missing something but it doesn't seem to me that the test performed can possibly lead to the conclusion that end-to-end encryption definitely does not exist as suggested by the headline.
The article itself raises the possibility of the following scenario:1. Message encrypted by ""A"" such that only ""B"" can decrypt it.2. Message is passed from ""A"" to ""B"" without being decrypted.3. Message is decrypted by ""B""'s local client.4. ""B""'s local client parses internet URLs and sends them to Microsoft's SmartScreen filter.5.

But would this not would show the results presented in this article while still being end-to-end encryption?
How can you rule out this scenario from this test?If the local client is reading the info and acting on it then it's not end-to-end encryption. It is still a MiM scenario only that the ""Middle"" is really close to one of the endpoints a Man at almost the Endpoint attack if you want to name it.

Neiman Marcus breach affected up to 1.1 million cards
Neiman Marcus breach affected up to 1.1 million cards
Fraudulent purchases began in December but Neiman Marcus wasn't aware of the malware until Jan. 1.
Clues that revealed a serious security breach of Neiman Marcus customers credit cards unfolded over the holidays as thieves were probably buying gifts.Dallas-based Neiman Marcus disclosed late Wednesday that 1.1 million credit and debit cards used at its stores may have been compromised in last years malware security breach. The theft occurred through malware that collected payment card data from July 16 to Oct. 30. Fraudulent purchases began to show up in December during the thick of the holiday shopping season. The malicious software has been disabled. Visa MasterCard and Discover have found 2400 cards belonging to customers of Neiman Marcus and Last Call clearance centers that were used fraudulently the company said.CEO Karen Katz apologized to customers in a letter published on its website.We deeply regret and are very sorry that some of our customers payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores Katz said in the online letter.The company said it first learned that malware had been installed on its system on Jan. 1 when it was notified by a forensics firm. In mid-December Neiman Marcus had been notified by its payment processor that some potentially unauthorized card activity had occurred after customers made purchases at its stores.Our goal is to do everything possible to restore your trust and to earn your loyalty Katz said in the letter. We aim to protect your personal and financial information. We want you always to feel confident shopping at Neiman Marcus and your trust in us is our absolute priority.In a letter to Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. dated Wednesday Neiman Marcus chief information officer Michael Kingston outlined how the company learned about the breach.The letter was a response to Blumenthals recommendation that Neiman Marcus should provide free credit-monitoring and identity theft insurance to all its customers.Friday the 13thOn the evening of Friday Dec. 13 Neiman Marcus was notified by its processor that Visa had identified an unknown number of fraudulent credit card uses. The cards had a common link: They had all been used at a small number of Neiman Marcus stores.On Dec. 17 the company received a report from MasterCard that 122 cards used at one Neiman Marcus store had later been used fraudulently. Additional reports came in from Visa and MasterCard over the next couple of days.On Dec. 20 Neiman Marcus hired a forensic investigative firm. On Dec. 23 the retailer contacted federal law enforcement. On Dec. 29 Neiman Marcus hired a second forensic firm Stroz Friedberg to independently investigate whether the retailers system had been compromised.The first firm discovered the malware on New Years Day. The malware was complex and its output of data was encrypted. It took a few days to untangle the algorithm and create a script that would disable it. The malware was discovered in additional stores on Jan. 6. It was disabled by Jan. 10.As of this week no fraudulent activity has been identified with the private-label cards of Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman which has two stores under the Neiman Marcus umbrella as a result of the malware the company said.The retailer is notifying all customers who shopped at its stores since January 2013. Its also offering one free year of credit-monitoring and identity theft protection to anyone who shopped at its stores over the past year. Thats three times the number of people who may have been exposed Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said.As a leading luxury department store Neiman Marcus caters to wealthy and financially savvy shoppers. So far customers have reacted positively to how it has handled the situation Reeder said.Neiman Marcus has only accepted Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards for a couple of years. Before November 2011 customers paying with credit were limited to using the companys branded cards or American Express.Through its 30-year-old InCircle loyalty program Neiman Marcus has a close relationship with its best customers. In 2012 about 40 percent of its annual sales came from the 144000 InCircle members who achieved reward status. These members spend 17 times more annually than its other customers.What thieves didnt getSo far the company said it has learned that no Social Security numbers or birth dates were stolen. Online shoppers dont appear to have been affected. PIN numbers werent at risk because the retailer doesnt use PIN pads in its stores.Neiman Marcus said it has no knowledge of any link to the Target Corp. breach which occurred during the key holiday shopping season. Hackers stole about 40 million credit and debit card numbers from Target customers and may have gotten personal information such as email and home addresses from as many as 70 million customers.Dallas-based iSight Partners a global cyber intelligence firm has been working with the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security to track the cyber scammers. In a report published this month iSight said that the Target security breach was probably part of a broader scam and that additional retailers may have been affected.No other chains have disclosed a breach to their customers yet.For over a century our companys mission has been dedicated to delivering exceptional service to each of our customers and responding properly to this attack is our top priority Katz said.Follow Maria Halkias on Twitter at @MariaHalkias.

Google will let companies target ads using your email address
Google will soon let advertisers tap into one of the most lucrative types of ad targeting: email addresses. The search giant is rolling out a new tool calledCustomer Matchwhich lets advertisers use a list of email addresses to target specific users across Google services. To be targeted through this technique you only need to be logged into your Google account and have given your email address to a retailer perhaps by buying something from their website or giving it out to sign up for a loyalty program. Google says the individual email addresses are anonymized through Customer Match. That means companies won't be able to create personalized profiles of individuals but they will still be compiling lists with general customer habits like YouTube viewing and Google search histories to target ads with.
For instance Google will let a retailer you've shopped at upload your email address to Customer Match so that it can serve up ads while you're watching YouTube searching Google for related products or checking your Gmail inbox while signed into that email account. The ad product also lets companies create a general audience profile based on existing customers' habits and interests to target new customers when they use Google services.
Google rose to the upper echelon of tech titans by amassing a lion's share of the web advertising market. Now the company is looking for new forms of ad revenue as more consumers gravitate toward mobile devices where an ad's money-making potential is reduced. Further complicating Google's position arestrategic moves from Apple and Facebook to reduce the strength of the web. Apple is doing this by allowing new ad-blocking software on iOS 9 accessible only from using its own mobile Safari web browser as opposed to Google's Chrome. Facebook on the other hand has created a robust web and mobile ad service from within its social network while expanding the variety of the web's information from news articles to videos users can access right from their News Feed.
By tapping into email addresses as both Facebook and Twitter do with their own respective products Google can take higher cuts of the more costly and better targeted ads being served even from within the Gmail and YouTube apps on mobile devices. Google calls Customer Match a ""privacy-safe"" product but that may not quell the concern of users who feel that advertisers are getting even more specific with their ad targeting.

LinkedIn's iPhone App Sparks Latest Privacy Controversy Over Mobile Devices
Security researchers have discovered a feature on LinkedIn's iPhone and iPad app that sends detailed information from users' calendars to the company's servers without their knowledge or consent.
If iPhone users ""opt-in"" to the app's calendar feature the app automatically sends all of users' calendar entries within a five-day time frame to LinkedIn's servers researchers say. This can include the subject time and location of meetings as well as the names and email addresses of the meeting organizer and attendees. It can also include meeting notes ""which tend to contain highly sensitive information such as conference call details and passcodes"" Yair Amit and Adi Sharabani researchers at Skycure Security said in a blog post Tuesday. As an example they said users may create a ""financial results"" meeting on their calendar and it would be sent to LinkedIn's servers.
The manner in which the app transmits sensitive data is a possible violation of Apple's privacy guidelines the researchers said.
""We are concerned by the fact it collects and sends-out sensitive information about its users without a clear indication and consent"" the researchers said. They were scheduled to present their findings at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday at Tel-Aviv University.
In a blog post Wednesday responding to the findings Joff Redfern head of mobile products at LinkedIn said the app's calendar feature will no longer send data from meeting notes to the app's servers. He said that the changes would be available soon and that the company has added a link so users can learn more about how the calendar data is used.
Redfern said LinkedIn syncs its app's calendar feature with the calendar on users' mobile devices so that people can see the LinkedIn profiles of people they are about to meet. He noted that the company asks users' permission before accessing their calendars and that people can opt-in to the feature. Information from users' calendars is sent securely and not shared or stored on its servers he said.
""Its a great feature"" Redfern said. ""We hope you try it out. If at any time you decide its not for you then you can always go to the mobile apps settings page to turn off the calendar feature.""
The researchers' findings are the latest controversy surrounding mobile apps leaking sensitive data without users' knowledge.
In February a programmer in Singapore revealed that Path a popular new social networking app for the iPhone was uploading users' address books to its servers without users' knowledge. Path later released a new version of the app that asks for permission before uploading the information acknowleding in a blog post ""We made a mistake.""
In December a researcher found hidden software installed on smart phones called Carrier IQ that logged text messages Google searches and phone numbers from about 150 million smart phones and reported them to mobile phone carriers. The researcher's findings sparked calls for investigation in Congress and resulted in a class-action lawsuit against the software's maker Carrier IQ Inc. based in Mountain View Calif.

A shock in the dark: Flashlight app tracks your location
The element of surprise causes hard feelings when it comes to privacy violations and mobile phone apps are ambushing consumers far too often according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.
Researchers at the school's Human-Computer Interaction Institute studied both the data gathered by the 100 most popular programs in Google's Android app store and how surprised users were when told what the apps were doing. On Tuesday they released a list of the 10 worst offenders in terms of transparency.
Almost no one was surprised that Google Maps accessed location information for example but respondents had a strong negative reaction when they learned that the Brightest Flashlight app tracked their location said Jason Hong an associate professor at school.
There's no sensible reason why a flashlight app would need your location"" Hong said. ""That was the biggest surprise to people -- 95 percent were surprised it used location data.""
Of the top 100 Android apps 56 collected location information device identifiers and/or contact lists according to the universitys research. Users however often had no idea such data was being collected or how it might be used. For example 58 percent of those asked about an app that collected device IDs were unaware that they could be used for marketing purposes; another 55 percent said the same about GPS location data.
It turns out that data collection and surprise is a toxic combination for users.
Using both elements Hong and Professor Norman Sadeh created a list of the 10 worst privacy offenders  apps that collected data and surprised users. The list wasnt ranked though Hong said the flashlight app registered the most surprise. The list wasnt ranked though Hong said the flashlight app registered the most surprise.
The full list along with the potentially controversial data collected by each according to the researchers:
An email sent to the contact address at BrightestFlashlight.com wasn't returned. The website lists no contact phone number.
One intriguing and promising element of the research surrounds the notion of expectation and disclosure said Hong. Many consumers registered less frustration about data collection when researchers explained to consumers precisely why it was necessary or how the information was used.
For example Dictionary.com's collection of location information allows the app to offer a fun feature: words others nearby are searching for. That explanation made users much less likely to feel like their privacy had been violated Hong said.
""Universally every time we gave an explanation people were more comfortable with the app. That shows how important disclosures can be"" he said. It's important to emphasize that privacy policies don't work. Transparency is good but we need to find right way of doing it.
The more unusual data collection might be the more important prominent disclosure becomes the study found. For example the Backgrounds wallpaper apps access of contact information allows users to change their phone's screen appearance when a call or text comes in from a specific contact. But many users were unaware why contact access would be needed.
""We could create better privacy based on people's expectations"" Hong said. ""For many apps the way the data is being used isn't obvious.""
Users who download Android apps are shown a box which indicates what kind of data the app might collect but multiple studies show that users merely ignore the disclosure just as they do with website privacy policies.
But even for those who read carefully mere disclosure that data is collected isn't enough said Sadeh the Carnegie Mellon professor.
""When you look at the fundamental issue it's about informing users and giving them an option"" he said. ""You need to say more to users than 'I need permission to collect this.' You need to tell them what you will do with what you collect. ... When you communicate you put people at ease.""
Mobile apps on all platforms fail to give users this critical ""how-will-my-data-be-used"" information Sadeh said but he said app developers weren't the only ones to blame.
""The platforms invite developers to collect more information than you would like"" he said. ""And the developers can hide behind what the app store offers (for disclosure options). They can say 'Hey there's no way for me to offer more.' It's up to these marketplaces to make an effort to convey more information.""

U.S.|Patient Data Posted Online in Major Breach of Privacy
Patient Data Posted Online in Major Breach of Privacy
A medical privacy breach led to the public posting on a commercial Web site of data for 20000 emergency room patients at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto Calif. including names and diagnosis codes the hospital has confirmed. The information stayed online for nearly a year.
Since discovering the breach last month the hospital has been investigating how a detailed spreadsheet made its way from one of its vendors a billing contractor identified as Multi-Specialty Collection Services to a Web site called Student of Fortune which allows students to solicit paid assistance with their schoolwork.Gary Migdol a spokesman for Stanford Hospital and Clinics said the spreadsheet first appeared on the site on Sept. 9 2010 as an attachment to a question about how to convert the data into a bar graph.Although medical security breaches are not uncommon the Stanford breach was notable for the length of time that the data remained publicly available without detection.
Even as government regulators strengthen oversight by requiring public reporting of breaches and imposing heavy fines experts on medical security said the Stanford breach spotlighted the persistent vulnerability posed by legions of outside contractors that gain access to private data.
Data on Stanford Hospital patients ended up on a Web site for soliciting paid help for homework.
The spreadsheet included names diagnosis codes account numbers admission and discharge dates and billing charges for patients seen at Stanford Hospitals emergency room during a six-month period in 2009 Mr. Migdol said. It did not include Social Security numbers birth dates credit-card numbers or other information used to perpetrate identity theft he said but the hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients.The breach was discovered by a patient and reported to the hospital on Aug. 22 according to a letter written four days later to affected patients by Diane Meyer Stanford Hospitals chief privacy officer. The hospital took aggressive steps and the Web site removed the post the next day Ms. Meyer wrote. It also notified state and federal agencies Mr. Migdol said.
It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public he said. It is our intent 100 percent of the time to keep this information confidential and private and we work hard every day to ensure that.Diane Dobson of Santa Clara Calif. said her jaw dropped on Saturday when she intercepted the letter from Ms. Meyer addressed to her 21-year-old son who she said had received emergency psychiatric treatment at Stanford in 2009. Ms. Dobson said it could have been disastrous if her son who lives at home had learned that his name was linked to a mental health diagnosis.My son I can tell you is fragile and confused enough that this would have sent him over the edge Ms. Dobson said saying she decided to speak publicly now because of her frustration with the breach. Everyone with an electronic medical record is at risk and that means everyone.Records compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that personal medical data for more than 11 million people have been improperly exposed during the past two years alone.
Since passage of the federal stimulus package which includes provisions requiring prompt public reporting of breaches the government has received notice of 306 cases from September 2009 to June 2011 that affected at least 500 people apiece. A recent report to Congress tallied 30000 smaller breaches from September 2009 to December 2010 affecting more than 72000 people.The major breaches  a disconcerting log of stolen laptops hacked networks unencrypted records misdirected mailings missing files and wayward e-mails  took place in 44 states.
One occurred at the Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford in January 2010 when a desktop computer holding the medical records of 532 patients was stolen from the heart center by an employee. Hospital officials said at the time that no patient information was compromised.But the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $250000 the maximum allowed for failing to report the breach within five days of discovery as is required under state law. The hospital appealed the fine and a settlement has been reached but not yet disclosed a department spokesman said.The Stanford episode reinforces the fear that even the most prestigious medical centers are not immune to risk.
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston which trains Harvard medical students agreed this year to pay a $1 million federal fine after an employee left paper medical records on a subway while commuting to work. The pages included the names of 192 patients and diagnoses for about a third of them including diagnoses for H.I.V./AIDS. They were never recovered.The Department of Health and Human Services viewed the breach as a potential violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act the 1996 law that requires protection of medical records.Mr. Migdol the hospital spokesman said Stanford had concluded that there is no employee from Stanford Hospital who has done anything impermissible. He said he expected the federal Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own investigation. Susan McAndrew a deputy director in the departments Office for Civil Rights said she could not discuss whether an investigation was in progress.The vendor identified by Mr. Migdol as Multi-Specialty Collection Services L.L.C. based in Los Angeles is described on its Web site as a subsidiary of Texican Inc. Joe Anthony Reyna who is listed in state and commercial records as Texicans principal did not respond to messages left at his office and home.Mr. Migdol said the company created the spreadsheet as part of a billing-and-payment analysis for the hospital. He said the hospital immediately suspended its relationship with the contractor and received written certification that previous files would be destroyed or returned securely.
Tina Warner a vice president at Chegg an online company that bought Student of Fortune in August said the sites principals were unaware the data had been posted until informed by the hospital. They then took it down within 30 seconds she said. Ms. Warner said the identity of the person who posted the Stanford data could not be determined from the user name.Bryan Cline a vice president with the Health Information Trust Alliance a nonprofit company that establishes privacy guidelines for health providers said nearly 20 percent of breaches involved outside contractors accounting for more than half of all the records exposed.Dr. Cline said health care providers depend unjustifiably on legal contracts with vendors to protect medical records. That just doesnt work as we can see he said. You have to do due diligence something to assure yourself that the people youre giving your data to can be trusted.

pri_250_db,bug causes private chats to be visible to the frie.txt,"Facebook Security Flaw Publicizes Private Chats - The New York Times
The security flaw allowed users to see active chats and friend requests on a friends pages.
Including new information about the security flaw and adding comment from Facebook.
8:10 p.m. | 2nd Update Read our latest story on the Facebook privacy flaw: Glitch Heightens Facebook Privacy Concerns
A security flaw was discovered on the Facebook Web site early Wednesday morning that enabled users to see private chats taking place between friends. Another security issue allowed users to see their online friends pending social requests.
reported by TechCrunch ismade visible through a Preview My Profile function on a users privacy page which has beenavailablesince September 2008.
Barry Schnitt director of policy communications at Facebook said the bug was live for a few hours and had nothing to do with the changes from April 21 during the companys latest developers conference.
Facebook did not notify individual users who had been subjected to the privacy flaw although Mr. Schnitt said We did notify people via the Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/facebook).
The chat feature is currently disabled on the site while the company works to rectify thesituation.
In a statement sent to The New York Times and other press outlets Facebook said it was aware of the bug and working to fix it:
For a limited period of time a bug permitted some users chat messages and pending friend requests to be made visible to their friends by manipulating the preview my profile feature of Facebook privacy settings. When we received reports of the problem our engineers promptly diagnosed it and temporarily disabled the chat function. We also pushed out a fix to take care of the visible friend requests which is now complete. Chat will be turned back on across the site shortly. We worked quickly to resolve this matter ensuring that once the bug was reported to us a solution was quickly found and implemented.
Facebook has been under heavy scrutiny for its latest privacy settings since the company announced its new Connections feature last month at f8 its yearly developer conference. At the time Facebook also made changes to its privacy policy and privacy settings. Since then the company has drawn heavy criticism from consumer watchdogs and government officials.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation an online civil liberties group has been highly critical of the sites newest features. In a blog post last week the E.F.F. said Facebooks latest changes to the site reduce control of an individuals personal
information and dont offer an easy opt-out preference for many of the sites latestfeatures.
In addition last week four United States senators including Charles E. Schumer of New York asked the Federal Trade Commission to develop a series of privacyguidelinesfor social networking Web sites specifically citing Facebook MySpace and Twitter that would give users a standard level of privacy over their personal information.

This is a post Ive been wanting to write for a while. In fact it stems from something I noticed way back in August of last year. After digging for answers and even a couple attempts at contacting their customer support Ive concluded that LinkedIn is by far the creepiest social network.
The primary reasons LinkedIn is the mustached trench coat and wire frame glasses wearing mouth breather of the internet are the People You May Know and People Also Viewed features.
Lets begin with the People You May Know feature. Every time I sign in Im startled by one of the names they suggest. My reactions range from How did you know I know them? to Theres no way you should know I know them to Ok I dont know that person but they have the same name as someone I do know and you shouldnt even know that.
Lets begin by showing some examples of the names that have popped up under the People You May Know sidebar widget (the names have been changed to protect the people I may know) along with a brief description of their association with me:
Steve Jacobs Safety Administrator: Steve happens to be my girlfriends stepfather. Steve has a total of 6 connections none of which are 2nd or 3rd degree connections with any of mine he lives an hour away from me and is in a completely different industry. Im not even friends with my girlfriend on Facebook
Stephanie Veldt Office Manager at Ted's Auto: This is a cousin of mine. However she has only one connection on LinkedIn. So just because we share a last name we might know each other? Lucky guess LinkedIn.
Heather Zufred Legal Secretary: Heather happens to be a girl I dated way back in high school. Cute right? Were friends on Facebook but thats pretty much the extent of it. The only problem is this person is the wrong Heather. This Heather has a different profession and lives on the other side of the country. She has barely any connections and no discernible link to me other than the name she shares with someone I do know.
Lucy Hatsbaugh CPA Certified Public Accountant at TGD: This is the maiden name of my aunt who was married into the family years ago. However my aunt of course has a different name now isnt on LinkedIn and isnt a CPA. Im pretty perplexed on this one. This person lives across the country and has zero connections.
At this point I think I have a theory on whats going on here. Even though I have no shared connections school company or industry LinkedIn is using the search and viewing history of other people to make assumptions on who I may know. In other words if someone searched for both of us we might know each other.
A couple more People I May Know included Herman and Doug. Herman follows me on Twitter but happens to live in the Netherlands. Weve never had any other association. Doug lives in New York and contacted me through my personal site a year ago. We exchanged a couple emails and that was it. We share no groups no connections or anything else.
Okay so maybe they are getting Twitter data somehow? How they knew about the guy I emailed I still have no idea
But wait according to LinkedIns Help Center on the People You May Know feature these suggestions are based on just 2 factors (straight from the Help Center page):
Commonalities between you and other members. For example you may have common connections similar profile information and experiences work at the same company or in the same industry or attended the same school.Members youve imported from other address books in your Contacts list.
I dont currently and havent previously used the Imported Contact feature and as described above several of these suggestions share no clear link to me in the online worldconnections experiences companies industries and school included.
Also nowhere does it mention Twitter or Facebook data so those theories are out. However after perusing my LinkedIn settings I found three different areas where Privacy Controls are listed. If you go to your Settings page and click on Profile you will see privacy controls for a variety of profile related issues. If you click on the Account tab you can adjust privacy controls for advertising. However I hadnt noticed (mainly because I didnt think to look for privacy controls in more than one place) the privacy options under the Groups Companies & Applications tab.
There I found two more controls that were pre-selected:
Okay so LinkedIn had been sharing my data with third party applications and plugins. So maybe they are using something like Facebook to influence these suggestions? Well not necessarily. First they didnt list it as a source for feeding the People You May Know feature and second they told me so in this reply to one of my multiple inquiries to customer support on the matter:
Well that didnt accomplish much. This person just reiterated what the Help Center page said. Also on a side note: The fact that they have a Trust & Safety team actually makes me feel more uncomfortable.
Either way I unchecked the new-found privacy controls under Groups Companies & Applications only to find that a day later LinkedIn suggested Tami Franks Customer Service Specialist. Tami has a total of 5 connections lives in Seattle no public company or title listed but we just happened to exchange a few emails a couple days prior regarding some questions I had about software her company sold.
A final thought I had was that maybe I was missing a setting within these other applications such as Facebook allowing them to share my information with partner sites. Upon checking my Facebook controls I found the following personalization setting:
but LinkedIn isnt one of their partner websites. On another note it seems that Facebook in sensitive about this topic as I received this prompt when I disabled instant personalization:
I still believe that LinkedIn is using the search history of others to suggest people I may know to me which sort of make sense. However I am still stumped on how they came up with some of these names. I voiced my concerns to their customer supportahemtheir Trust & Safety team and received only canned responses. If you have any more insight on this I would love to hear it.
Okay to close this creepiness out were going to play a game. This game requires you to be a bit of a creep yourself for a moment so if youre uncomfortable with that feel free to bow out now we wont make fun of you.
You see LinkedIn as a company isnt the only thing creepy about LinkedIn. In fact it has a pretty creepy user base as well. I can prove it too. (Note: I imagine no one has pointed this out because they dont want to look like a creep themselves by broaching the subject. I suppose Ill take one for the team)
The game is simple. Go through your connections and pick out the profile of someone who happens to be in your opinion uma young attractive female. Try not to feel creepy yet this is for science.
On their profile page take notice of the People Also Viewed list in the sidebar. What kind of faces do you see? Chances are they are of more erm young and attractive females. If youre a real science fanatic click through to one of these profiles then do it again on that profile. Within a couple clicks you will likely be on the profile of a model from across the country.
In other words People Also Viewed creates a public graph of creepy mens browsing habits at work.
Thus concludes my venture into the deep uncomfortable underbelly of social networking for professionals. LinkedIn has slipped under the radar when it comes to privacy controls and transparency which I believe is unacceptable. Everyone points to Google Apple and Facebook and pretty much stops there.
Ive also always been frustrated with LinkedIns controls constantly finding more boxes I need to uncheck to stop receiving notifications.
LinkedIn has experienced substantial growth in recent years but they seem to be overstepping their bounds in certain areas. They should also keep a close eye on their usersbecause no one wants another Chatroulette-style takeover
Lastly my sincere apologies if a mustache trench coat and wire frame glasses happen to be your look.

Technology|Europe Says Search Firms Are Violating Data Rules
BERLIN  European Union officials on Wednesday said Google Microsoft and Yahoo had violated rules
by keeping data on individual computer users for too long.
European national privacy chiefs said it would also ask the United States Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the data retention practices of the three companies violated American law.In a letter sent Wednesday the advisory panel to the European Commission asked the three companies to appoint outside auditors to verify that their practices of rendering individual data anonymous truly eliminated all links to individuals.Under European Union data protection rules search engines are required to sever all traceable links to individual computer users completely and irrevocably after six months.
S.E.C. Proposes Uniform Audit Trail for TradesMAY 26 2010
European data protection officials have been urging the search engines since 2007 to shorten the time they retain information on computer users. In response the engines have cut retention periods from 18 months but the moves are still not enough to satisfy the regulators.Of the three companies Microsoft which operates the Bing search engine has said it would
comply with the commissions request to render data from individuals anonymous after six months but it still plans to retain software cookies and other session identifiers for 18 months.Google retains data for nine months and Yahoo has said it will remove part of a computers unique identification number the Internet protocol address after 90 days but reserved the right to recreate individual logs at the request of law enforcement authorities.In its letter to the three companies the panel of privacy chiefs called the Article 29 Working Party said all three methods were insufficient and violated European Union data protection rules.The data in question includes all types of information that a computer user enters into a search engine field which is then collected to build a personal profile of preferences that can help search engines direct ads more narrowly to individuals.Search engines say they need to keep the data longer to make the search process more efficient and relevant.In its letter the European group singled out Google the global search leader which has about 80 percent of the European search market according to comScore a research firm.Considering Googles dominant position in almost every E.U. member state with a market share of up to 95 percent in some national search engine markets the company has a significant role in European citizens daily lives the European panel wrote. The companys apparent lack of focus in data retention is concerning.A Google spokesman Al Verney said the company had not yet received the letter from the panel but he said that the group apparently had asked questions of all major search engines not just Google.Google was the first search engine to reduce the time it stores search logs and the first to make them anonymous Mr. Verney said.
We develop our policies he added based on what provides the best experience for users both in terms of respect for their privacy and the quality and security of our services. Our current retention policy represents the most responsible balance between these two important concerns.In a related privacy issue Google balked at a German government regulators request to surrender Internet data it had improperly collected from unsecured wireless networks there saying the company needed more time to resolve legal issues.As granting access to payload data creates legal challenges in Germany which we need to review we are continuing to discuss the appropriate legal and logistical process for making the data available said Peter Barron a Google spokesman in London. We hope given more time to be able to resolve this difficult issue.The data protection supervisor in Hamburg Johannes Caspar had given Google until midnight Wednesday in Germany to surrender the data or risk unspecified sanctions. Mr. Caspar was not immediately available for comment.Google collected the data over unsecured Wi-Fi networks while compiling its Street View photo map archive.

White House Seeks to Clarify F.B.I. Powers vis--vis E-Mail
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration has asked Congress to give clear authority to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain records related to the context of e-mails and other Internet-based communications without first obtaining a warrant from a judge.Some advocates of electronic privacy have raised alarms about the proposal saying it could expand government eavesdropping on computer activity without court oversight. Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Thursday that the proposal raised serious privacy and civil liberties concerns.The administration portrays its proposal first reported by The Washington Post as a mere technical fix to clarify a confusingly written statute and says it would not grant the F.B.I. any new powers. It says that F.B.I. agents have been requesting such information for years and that most Internet service providers routinely provide it.The statute as written causes confusion and the potential for unnecessary litigation said Dean Boyd a Justice Department spokesman. This clarification will not allow the government to obtain or collect new categories of information but it seeks to clarify what Congress intended when the statute was amended in 1993.Specifically administration officials have asked Congress to include a provision in the 2011 intelligence authorization bill modifying the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which forbids companies that handle electronic communications  including Internet service providers and Web-based companies like Google  to reveal customer information without a court warrant.The act makes exceptions for information relevant to national-security investigations when speed can be essential. For example it allows F.B.I. agents to issue a
national-security letter requiring a company to turn over records listing the phone numbers someone has called although a warrant is still required to eavesdrop on the content of calls.The proposal would add electronic communication transactional records  like e-mail addresses used in correspondence and Web pages visited  to a list of the categories of information that F.B.I. agents can demand.The Justice Department contends that the F.B.I. already has the authority to obtain such Internet records with a national-security letter because electronic communications transactional records are mentioned elsewhere in the act although not in that specific list.A 2008 memorandum written for
the bureau by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel said that the
specific list of categories of information that the F.B.I. can demand
is ""exhaustive."" Still a footnote said that ""categories of information parallel
to subscriber information and toll bill records for ordinary telephone services""
e-mail addresses to which people send messages and the Web pages they visit are
the functional equivalent of the phone numbers they call. Officials familiar with
the matter speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue say
that most companies agree with that interpretation and have routinely turned over such
records when requested.At least one company has balked
though saying it feared a lawsuit for illegally turning over private information. The

pri_250_db,windows 10 update was pulled because it forgot cer.txt,"Windows 10 November update was pulled for forgetting privacy settings; its now back | Ars Technica
Windows 10 November update was pulled for forgetting privacy settings; its now back
Four privacy settings were reset to their defaults when upgrading Windows 10.
The mystery behind the removal of the Windows 10 November Update version 1511 has been revealed. Last week Microsoft received reports that when upgrading from the Windows 10 July release to the November update four privacy-related settings were getting reset to their default values. Concerned that there might be a significant problem Microsoft removed the November Update from Windows Update for existing Windows 10 users and also removed the updated Media Creation Tool used to create install media.
When upgrading from the initial Windows 10 release to the new version four settings (whether to allow apps to use a unique advertiser ID which apps are allowed to run in the background whether Smartscreen Web filtering is enabled and whether settings sync between devices) were reverted to their defaults as if a fresh Windows installation had been performed. While for most users this made no difference for those who'd disabled those features previously the upgrade would silently revert those choices.
Oddly upgrading from Windows 7 or 8 to Windows 10 wasn't affected and the November Update was still being rolled out over Windows Update to people upgrading from those operating systems. Only those already on Windows 10 were affected.
Microsoft has now fixed the upgrade/installation process to properly preserve these settings and the November Update has once more been made available to Windows 10 users through Windows Update. The updated Media Creation Tool has also been restored re-enabling clean installs of version 1511. The company has also published a knowledge-base article describing the issue and which settings are affected so any Windows 10 users who have already installed the November Update can double-check their settings and re-establish their preference if necessary.
In light of some of the other bugs that have been found in the November update it seems a little surprising that Microsoft would pull it for something that seems so minor. However the company has been under fire for privacy issues around Windows 10; this kind of vigorous reaction to even a minor privacy concern feels like an attempt to try to restore some of the lost trust and demonstrate that the company really does care about privacy.

pri_250_db,unexpected linking of text to a google+ account ac.txt,"Android and Google+ confusion outs trans woman | Technology | The Guardian
The company's decision to amalgamate its SMS and chat apps has made it too easy for users to leak personal information
Google+ integrates heavily with Google Hangouts which can expose personal information unwillingly. Photograph: CTK/Alamy
Google is facing renewed criticism over the integration of Google+ into its Android operating system after a transgender woman was outed when using Google's Hangouts app.
Since the release of the latest mobile software Android 4.4 codenamed KitKat the instant messaging app Hangouts has become the default text-messaging app on phones and tablets running with the newly installed operating system.
But the behaviour of the app is confusing even to seasoned Android users and can result in personal information being inadvertently shared. If a message is sent as an SMS the recipient only sees the phone number it came from but if it is sent as a Google message then they can see the sender's entire public Google profile.
In at least one instance this has already caused serious problems. A trans woman still using her old (male) name at work intended to send a text message to a colleague. Instead she sent a GChat message under the female name on her Google+ account.
""I'm just glad I live in a state where it'd be illegal to fire me"" said the woman who asked not to be named in this piece while she discusses matters with her employers. ""Somehow I didn't think through the potential consequences of Google+ embedding itself ever deeper into stock Android stuff.""
When typing a name into the Hangouts app if there are not many results in a users address book the app begins to search Google+ for matches instead; a simple mis-click can result in users sending a message revealing more contextual information than they intended.
When Google+ was launched the company faced criticism over its insistence that users use their real names on the site. That policy was weakened in the months following its launch and now Google allows people to use ""established identities"" as well as real names.
But as vice president of product Bradley Horowitz wrote in 2012: ""Its important to remember that when you change your name in Google+ youre changing it across all services that require a Google profile.""
The company has also been attacked for default settings on its devices and services which are too dismissive of users' privacy expectations. In October Google announced that it would begin attaching individuals' data to adverts sparking a revolt that saw many Google+ users changing their profile pictures to photographs of executive chairman Eric Schmidt.
And in December an update to Android briefly allowed users to manage privacy settings for individual apps before Google pulled the function. The Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for digital freedoms called the lack of per-app settings ""a Stygian hole in the Android security modelEmbarrassingly it is also one that Apple managed to fix in iOS years ago"".

pri_250_db,new ability to email google+ contacts whose email .txt,"Official Gmail Blog: Reach the people you know more easily
News tips and tricks from Google's Gmail team and friends.
Have you ever started typing an email to someone only to realize halfway through the draft that you haven't actually exchanged email addresses? If you are nodding your head 'yes' and already have a Google+ profile then youre in luck because now it's easier for people using Gmail and Google+ to connect over email. As an extension of some earlier improvements that keep Gmail contacts automatically up to date using Google+ Gmail will suggest your Google+ connections as recipients when you are composing a new email.
As you can tell from the example above these emails work a bit differently so that your email address is only shared with the people you want. Your email address isn't visible to a Google+ connection unless you send that person an email and likewise that persons email address isnt visible to you unless they send you an email.
You control whether people can reach you this way with a new setting in Gmail.
Emailing Google+ connections also takes advantage of Gmail's new inbox's categories. When someone in your circles emails you the email will appear in the Primary category.
But if you don't have them in your circles it will be filtered into the Social category (if enabled) and they'll only be able start another conversation with you if you respond or add them to your circles.

De-Friendly Fire: American University student makes Facebook rape accusation
On April 22 Chloe Rubenstein posted a note on her Facebook page.
ATTENTION WOMEN she wrote before identifying two American university students by name and calling them rapists. She went on: we should all be aware! Stay away at all costs. They are predators and will show no remorse for anyone. If you have been effected by either one of these sickos please feel free to talk to me. With enough help we can take them down!
Two months earlier the American University sophomore and a group of her fellow students had gathered to pass the time during the snowstorm. As feet of snow blanketed the city Rubensteins apartment filled with friends and one new acquaintancea male AU student who lived in the same building. They drank cheap vodka and danced. At the end of the night a female friend left the party and entered Rubensteins bedroom. Five minutes later the new guy followed. Rubenstein noticed and followed him in.
Four years earlier as a high school junior in Massachusetts Rubenstein found herself alone with a classmate she barely knew a football star she described as 100 percent muscle. Rubenstein was 16. She didnt tell anyone what happened for four months. Even after she moved to D.C. and entered college she wasnt comfortable calling the incident by its name. But when she walked into her own bedroom the night of the snowstorm she recognized what was happening. It was re-traumatizing for me. I was trying to wrap my head around it for a month says Rubenstein now 20. It was the same weird feeling I had had a month after I was raped.
Weeks after the snow had melted Rubenstein called her friend to see how she was doing. She refused to take Rubensteins calls but a mutual friend informed Rubenstein that the woman was still reeling from the events of the party. I started slowly trying to figure out what I was going to do about that Rubenstein says. Around the same time another friend informed her that she had recently been raped by another AU student in an unrelated incident. Then Rubenstein did something she couldnt do in high school: She attempted to tell as many people as possible what happened.
Rubenstein posted the note without consulting anyone on strategy. I just did it Rubenstein says. I followed what I believed was right to do at the time. The accusations were disseminated to 968 of her online friends. A dozen people clicked a box indicating that they liked the announcement.
Two female AU students sent Rubenstein private messages claiming that one of the alleged rapists had done some really screwed-up things to them too Rubenstein says. When she would see him in her building or on campus Rubenstein says that the accused would run in the opposite direction.
Others were more confrontational. On campus Rubenstein says that supporters of the accused started to walk in circles around me trying to intimidate me. She received several anonymous phone calls at odd hours. When she picked up the phone from a private number a male voice repeated the phrase Im a police officer and I have a few questions I need to ask you growing sterner with each iteration. Friends warned Rubenstein of the legal implications of making a rape accusation without absolute proof.
Youre playing with fire when you throw peoples names out admits Rubenstein. I was aware of the dangers of that. I knew it was a bold move she says. But when I told people that I was fully aware of what I was doing it made them feel a little more fearless. After that I started getting a lot more support from people.
Its been a banner year for controversial rape announcements on the American University campus. Added encouragement for Rubensteins activism came from an unlikely source: Alex Knepper a sophomore columnist for school newspaper the Eagle who devoted a great deal of column inches this year to complaining about AUs campus of victims. On March 28 Knepper published a column explaining how women who have been drinking cant really be raped: Lets get this straight: any woman who heads to an EI [fraternity] party as an anonymous onlooker drinks five cups of the jungle juice and walks back to a boys room with him is indicating that she wants sex OK? To cry date rape after you sober up the next morning and regret the incident is the equivalent of pulling a gun to someones head and then later claiming that you didnt ever actually intend to pull the trigger.
On the day the column was published an anonymous group of campus activists removed the papers from their stands returned them to the papers offices and hung posters printed with the words ""NO ROOM FOR RAPE APOLOGY"" around campus. Rubenstein participated in the stunt albeit halfheartedly. I took some of the copies and moved them around she says. The article was insulting to every woman who has ever been sexually assaulted on campus. So it was an effective action in the sense that it got people to talk but it was sort of an immature way to do it she says. But Kneppers column shifted something else for Rubenstein. I wasnt able to comfortably talk about rape until that article came out she says. Now I can say I am a victim of rape and Im not afraid to say it. But this time last year I wasnt saying that. This time three months ago I wasnt saying that.
On April 13 two weeks after the column dropped Rubenstein attended AUs Take Back the Night rally an annual demonstration against sexual violence. It was the first time Rubenstein openly referred to her experience in high school as a rape. A week later she wrote her Facebook note. Rubenstein says she posted it for all the women on AUs campus who might find themselves drunk at parties around the accused. At first I wasnt thinking that this was going to help my friends. I felt like I needed to warn everyone else about these guys Rubenstein says. After leaving the message up for a few days Rubenstein removed it. I dont clear my status because Im scared she wrote on Facebook. I clear it for legal reasons and because my message reached 968 people. If you or someone you know has been raped or sexually assaulted and needs a safe place to talk about how they feel or what can be done please contact me. No Fear. No Secrets. 2010.
After removing the note Rubenstein finally heard from the woman she had followed into the bedroom. Thats the most beautiful thing that came out of all this says Rubenstein. She called me and asked me why I took my status downShe said that if the other victims decide they
want to do something that she might want to be there to do something too she says. On Facebook 968 people can be warned of potential predators in an instant; reaching actual victims of sexual assault is more difficult. When it had happened to me in high school I did nothing about it Rubenstein says. There is not a day that goes by that I dont think about that. I promised myself that I would do whatever I possibly could when this happened to people I know. I just didnt expect it to happen to so many of them.

""Feminists promote abuse as being gendered this blog promotes abuse as being gendered day in day out the contributers promote use as gendered and work to suppress information that contradicts the politically correct pov.""
Evidence exists that women sexually violate men at similar rates as the reverse. Let's say it again. Evidence exists that women sexually violate men at similar rates as the reverse.
That's a datapoint towards equality; namely that women have just as dark a dark side as men. If the feminists here were really about proving 'equality' and not maintaining traditional gender concepts they'd be embracing these statistic and if they cared about male victims they would be rushing to shout these statistics far and wide.
One of the most common things I've heard from male victims is the relief they feel to learn they aren't alone. That alone is a huge help to them on the road to recovery. Feminists aren't looking for statistics that help male victims know they aren't alone; in fact they are ignoring and/or denying them when they come across them(just as squirrlygirl confessed to.)
Imagine that. Imagine being a feminist whose talking to a group of people about rape and trotting out the whole 95% of victims are women when she knows that there is evidence it isn't true(or at least a strong possibility it isn't). Or she hasn't even bothered to research anything counter to her ideology. Imagine what that must feel like to the (many) male victims in her audience who are simultaneously being told they're rare as unicorns and also that they(men) are really responsible for rape in a way that women could never be. They(male victims) are responsible for rape in a way that their rapists(women) are not.
Now add on top of all that let's add another dash of victim blaming 'men's patriarchal thinking is why men aren't coming forward about their victimization.'
This is sick behavior. And people wonder why I a queer progressive college educated woman don't identify as feminist. I'm your target market and yet... I just can't stomach the thought of being lumped in with the likes of you.
""Now add on top of all that lets add another dash of victim blaming mens patriarchal thinking is why men arent coming forward about their victimization.""
Why is this victim-blaming? Because implicit in the word 'patriarchy' is a system of social norms that men perpetuate for their own benefit. So when you say to a male victim that his 'patriarchal programming' is the reason why he doesn't come forward you are saying in essence:
""You are the beneficiary of a system that unjustly privileges your sex a side-effect of which is that you are humiliated when you feel disempowered by the 'weaker' sex. Which is why you're not able to confess to being a victim of rape by a woman. You are silenced by your own privilege! What delicious irony! Er... I mean how unfortunate for you that you support a system that benefits you greatly yet isn't helping you in this instance. Why not stop being your own worst enemy?'
It also carries a wonderful connotation of: ""If you'd just think the right way(our way) then you wouldn't be suffering so much.""
I imagine male rape victims just love to hear stuff like this. Considering that rape is something that can completely dominate a person's experience of self safety and human intimacy--dominate their life in other words--I'm sure it's wonderful for them to be reminded that their 'privileges' always eclipse whatever trauma they experience. And are usually the reason why half their trauma exists in the first place.
Maybe a male rape victim would rather trade being able to access the sympathy services and visibility that female rape victims have for the .01% greater chance that he might end up a CEO or a President.
I wonder if anyone's ever asked male rape victims that question.
If anyone's interested the following is an email exchange between myself and Amanda Hess the author of this piece.
Re your piece ""De-Friendly Fire"": I don't quite understand what happened when Chloe followed that guy into her bedroom as he was following another woman in there. Your second paragraph concludes ""Five minutes later the new guy followed. Rubenstein noticed and followed him in."" OK so what happened after that? Did he rape both of them? Did she do anything to prevent him from raping the other woman? What exactly went down in the bedroom? Unless I'm missing something just what happened is not made clear.
Sorry but I'm not interested in providing you a play-by-play of someone's rape experience.
That's inappropriate on your part. I didn't mean it like that. No one is asking for details. I just thought the piece lacked an explanation of what brought her to the realization that something happened that needed to be addressed. To simply say three people were in a room and leave it at that seems guaranteed to result in a lot of head-scratching.
I gather from your silence you would have us believe this woman walked into her bedroom and witnessed a rape and did nothing to try to prevent it. I sure hope she had some popcorn to keep her from being bored. And oh yeah we're also supposed to believe this man continued to commit rape while he had an audience sitting or standing there watching him.
Evidence exists that women sexually violate men at similar rates as the reverse. Lets say it again. Evidence exists that women sexually violate men at similar rates as the reverse.
That evidence only exists in the delusional minds of whiny-ass MRAs not in the real world under the yellow sun.
""That evidence only exists in the delusional minds of whiny-ass MRAs not in the real world under the yellow sun.""
No matter how many studies published in peer reviewed journals anyone produces this will be the response.
Feminists don't care about male victims. They just don't.
""It is not crazy how it works both ways. It is called logic."" I know... that's why I wrote it. :)
""Just because different actions can have similar outcome does not mean they are both good choices.""
Fair enough :) Like I said in an earlier post I'm still torn on this type of response... mostly because we haven't really seen the outcome of such actions yet. I AM interested to see how this all plays out though...
Your last comments are wilful innorance and hate on your part.
Most of the respondands on the thread and the thread author are in favour of this.
Feminists with their lynch mob attitude delusions of moral supremacy denial of victims of female abusers and support for reducing civil rights are the new fascist left.
""Feminists dont care about male victims. They just dont.""
And if anyone has the temerity to suggest that feminists should be more attuned to the issues of men the belittling and dismissive phrase ""what about teh menz?"" is the inevitable response.
Feminists bat for team vagina it's as simple as that. If the feminist ideology really cared about both genders it wouldn't be called ""feminism"".
""Feminists bat for team vagina its as simple as that.""
And that's fine even if that kind of one sided advocacy is not something I want to be apart of. But feminists will simultaneously 'bat for team vagina' and hold out that they also are the next best thing for men.
I'm beginning to wonder if simplistic analysis of reality like 'it's all the patriarchy's(men's) fault' or 'the jews are behind it all' or 'immigrants are destroying our country*' really only appeal to people who have a shallow understanding of human nature and little empathy.
The similarity between the patriarchal conspiracy theorists and the Jewish conspiracy theorists is particularly interesting. You could say a lot of the same things about men as you can about Jewish people: compared to gentiles they make more money often occupy proportionately more powerful positions in media and in the corporate world.
And then some people draw from these simple observations that they rule the world to their own nefarious ends. Except that just like Asian people Jewish people put a strong emphasis on family and inter-generational support. Cultures that do that tend to get ahead and that explains why natch Jewish people tend to get ahead.
Instead of looking for a simple down-to-earth explanation conspiracy theorists always reach for the deepest darkest most sinister reason for why their hated group of choice has something they don't/does something they don't like/is oppressing them.
When the police and society treat victims with respect women will willingly and eagerly go to the cops when they are assaulted.
Until then women should use every means of humiliation to keep boys in line. This girl did a great thing. If the accused boy wanted to defend himself he could come forward and do so.
""Instead of looking for a simple down-to-earth explanation conspiracy theorists always reach for the deepest darkest most sinister reason for why their hated group of choice has something they dont/does something they dont like/is oppressing them.""
Having missed all the really important and highly secretive Patriarchy meetings the overwhelmingly vast number of ordinary guys do not get promoted to CEO are not given cushy corner office jobs and don't get a place at the male privilege buffet. So they toil away at difficult and often dangerous jobs to do oppressive things like put food on the table pay for mortgages and try to avoid going to jail when child support payments fall behind.
""When the police and society treat victims with respect women will willingly and eagerly go to the cops when they are assaulted.""
And when you stop equating woman with victim the world will be a much fairer place for all.
""Until then women should use every means of humiliation to keep boys in line.""
What gives women the right* to do this? Do men get to use every means of humiliation to keep _girls_ in line?
* Even more interesting what gave women the _power_ to do this in the first place?
""Until then women should use every means of humiliation to keep boys in line. This girl did a great thing. If the accused boy wanted to defend himself he could come forward and do so.""
A MAJOR key piece of this story is obviously missing about what happened when Rubenstein walked into the room where the rape was taking place. I don't think anyone needs graphic ""play by play"" details but it is rather strange/suspicious that the story glosses over to several weeks later when she called her friend to see how she was doing.
So we are left to assume that she let her friend continue to be raped right in front of her and did nothing but call her weeks later? That would be pretty fucked up and cowardly of her if thats the case (which I hope it's not). Thats why an explanation of this part of the story is necessary whatever it may be otherwise we are basically left to believe she witnessed this rape
and did nothing to help her friend except for posting on FB weeks later?
I personally believe that this section of the story was omitted either because the author does not know the details of this part of the story or if she does they conflict with the angle of the story she was attempting to write. If these details emerged perhaps the ""Bad Guy"" who was smeared on FB might not look so guilty (whether
But when she walked into her own bedroom the night of the snowstorm she recognized what was happening. It was re-traumatizing for me. I was trying to wrap my head around it for a month says Rubenstein now 20. It was the same weird feeling I had had a month after I was raped.
Weeks after the snow had melted Rubenstein called her friend to see how she was doing. She refused to take Rubensteins calls but a mutual friend informed Rubenstein that the woman was still reeling from the events of the party.
@JJer---- I hope you sober up read this and wince:
""Until then women should use every means of humiliation to keep boys in line. This girl did a great thing. If the accused boy wanted to defend himself he could come forward and do so.""
Are you honestly saying that women have the right to make allegations of any sort using any vehicleany means necessary any forum to make them and that basically tough shit if the boy doesnt like it?
SO you wont be pissed then when I go to MY facebook lnk this page and post about how your father/husband/boyfriend/nephew etc gang raped and murdered a little girl in a back alley somewhere right?
Oh I'll use their full names pictures list their places of employment and education so I can protect others.
I mean after all they can come forward and say ""We didnt do it"" right?
""What gives women the right* to do this? Do men get to use every means of humiliation to keep _girls_ in line?
* Even more interesting what gave women the _power_ to do this in the first place?""

I think I'll cast my vote for the 'having a brain entitles one to rule' party.
So how does one go about identifying an alpha female? Does she leave piss stains to mark her territory? Or does she just point to her crotch and go 'OOG!'
She'll be dominate and will knock your horns off as the Iroquois would say if you misbehave.
""Shell be dominate and will knock your horns off as the Iroquois would say if you misbehave.""
Ah. So I imagine these alpha females have lots of hair claws and hibernate in the winter. I can't think of anything more dominant that gives birth then a female grizzly!
Lol...it's cute how you feel that anit-gynocentricism is tantamount to stupidity.
I don't think I should be handed anything just because of my gender.
I want things because I have actively earned them through my qualifications.
The reverse is also true I shouldn't be denied anything just because of my gender.
""Shell be dominate and will knock your horns off as the Iroquois would say if you misbehave.""
I presume she will also know that the correct incarnatin of the word is DOMINANT...as in she will be DOMINANT....
Now go pick up your horns love you've misbehaved enough and I am done with you.....
So how does one go about identifying an alpha female? Does she leave piss stains to mark her territory? Or does she just point to her crotch and go OOG!
Great artical it is about time that the rapists had no place to hide.
The only shame in being raped should be from the rapist and not the victim.
Grizzly bears are an excellent example of female power as are elephants and tigresses.
Among human alpha females an authoritative disposition is key to high rank not unlike that which is seen in the natural world.
Weak mothers make weak sons. You have potential though.
Toughen up and try not to collude with lesser males.
""Grizzly bears are an excellent example of female power as are elephants and tigresses.""
Not so much when you compare them to male grizzlies elephants and tigers.
The only mammal that comes to mind where the females are seen as stronger are hyenas but I could see where you'd like to avoid that particular comparison.
Males of said species are strong only in terms of brute strength not always wise in the expression of that strength.
The female sustains life including killing when necessary; thats female power.
Males can only take life unless they are pack animals. Only then do they become extensions of maternal care.
""Males of said species are strong only in terms of brute strength not always wise in the expression of that strength.""
****If you are still talking (bizarrely imo) about wild animals then I have to ask how the hell do you come up with this crap?
Wild animals are WILD..the female just as capable of aggression and brute strength as a male***
""The female sustains life including killing when necessary; thats female power.
Males can only take life unless they are pack animals. Only then do they become extensions of maternal care""
****So a females lethal aggression is justified and a product of a thought process which includes making moral judgments and is somehow without exception always noble(still talking about a wild animal mind you) but a male simply acts on bloodlust and rage?
And what does any of this have to do with the topic of the FB post?
You're simply using it as a platform for a stance on female supremacy and man bashing.
I was falsely accused of raping a girl when I was 16 but it wasn't by the female or even the parents. It was her older sister. I had apparently slighted this sister at some time. When everything was made clear I realized I had befriended her sister when we first started in high school. Then after a few weeks we just didn't hang out. Nothing happened just stopped hanging out.
Anyway I was both furious and ashamed. I had to find the gumption to confront my grade's counselor about the situation and have him help me with the whole situation. We all sat down and figured out how it got started. Things settled down and in fact the rumor didn't spread much. I guess because I I'll never know for sure. But a month or so later some angry young man sucker punched me on the way to an assembly. His motivation? He was dating the older sister that accused me of rape. I denied to press charges but you people need to seriously think about the ramifications of inflammatory statements like this.
Rape is terrible and should be fought in every way possible but you MUST realize there are ""solutions"" with too much collateral damage. Naming names requires proof and details. She could have achieved similar success without potentially fucking up peoples' lives. The young man in my story was probably convicted of assault.
Obviously not. I see you came back and posted again.
Chloe gave that boy a strong correction by posting his name. The most important part of the above blog is that the boy now runs from her when they're in the same room. Fear is a good thing in a young man. He's been outed and now less likely to assault again.
Many of our native American tribes were matriarchies and they managed their men well. There are a few matriarchies left and just like our native peoples they don't even have a word for rape.

Klout lets you delete the profile you didnt create Huh?
Klout the startup best known for its ability to measure a persons online influence is allowing people to remove Klout profiles that they didnt actually create.
Last week Klout altered the way it determines a persons Klout Score  the measure of a persons activity on a variety of social networks such as Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ and others. Based on an individuals interaction within those social networks Klout calculates the true reach of that persons communications and issues them a 1 to 100 Klout score.
The new way of measuring factored in profiles from people who havent even signed up for Klout. Those accounts which dont require an actual person to opt in are dubbed observers. For instance a second Twitter account that you occasionally use and/or a public Facebook profile that isnt connected to a Klout account will pop up in Klout as an observer profile.
Much in the same way that people have criticized services like Pipl and Spokeo some Klout users reacted negatively to the observer profiles. One user Tonia Ries questioned the ethics of the startups actions after finding an observer profile for her young son.
When I logged into my Klout page this morning I was very surprised to see that Klout now lists my son as one of the people I influence. Anyone who is a parent of a young adult will know that nothing is more unlikely Ries wrote in an article for The Realtime Report. Knowing that my son is not on Twitter and has always been very careful about managing his privacy on the Internet [I wondered] how did Klout get the information to create a profile on my son?
Because of concerns like this (as well as Klouts policy of not allowing anyone under the age of 13 to use the service) the company has decided to provide a way for anyone to delete their observer profile information. Anyone who wishes to do so can visit Klouts Opt Out page which requires you to enter in Twitter or Facebook credentials to verify that the account youd like to delete is actually yours. Note that we request only the bare minimum information provided by Twitter or Facebook for authentication. We will not store any of the data and will never share your information publicly Klout states.
The decision to allow people to delete their profile info is definitely the right move for Klout  especially since it uses personal information in its business dealings. However I suspect that many people will still react negatively since it does require you to opt-out of the service.
And despite the potential backlash the practice of adding observer profiles to Klout only enhances its ability to accurately measure a persons true influence online. Im sure the company weighed these two factors before deciding to go forward.
Ultimately were only using publicly available information about people that plenty of other sites are already taking advantage of Klout CEO Joe Fernandez told VentureBeat. He added that anyone who is fearful of personal information gathered on a Klout observer profile should re-examine the privacy setting on Facebook and Twitter. The only information that shows up on a (observer) profile is stuff that those users have decided to allow the world to see.
Founded in August 2008 the San Francisco-based company previously raised an initial $1.5 million round followed by a second $8.5 million round in January 2011. The company has a total of $11 million in funding to date from Kleiner Greycroft Partners ff Asset Management and others. Klout is rumored to be raising a new $30 million fund that would value the startup at an estimated $200 million.

Media|New Web Code Draws Concern Over Privacy Risks
Worries over Internet privacy have spurred lawsuits conspiracy theories and consumer anxiety as marketers and others invent new ways to track computer users on the Internet. But the alarmists have not seen anything yet.
In the next few years a powerful new suite of capabilities will become available to Web developers that could give marketers and advertisers access to many more details about computer users online activities. Nearly everyone who uses the Internet will face the privacy risks that come with those capabilities which are an integral part of the Web language that will soon power the Internet: HTML 5.The new Web code the fifth version of Hypertext Markup Language used to create Web pages is already in limited use and it promises to usher in a new era of Internet browsing within the next few years. It will make it easier for users to view multimedia content without downloading extra software; check e-mail offline; or find a favorite restaurant or shop on a smartphone.
Most users will clearly welcome the additional features that come with the new Web language.
Samy Kamkar created software to show how thoroughly computers could be infiltrated by the latest Web technology.
Its going to change everything about the Internet and the way we use it today said James Cox 27 a freelance consultant and software developer at Smokeclouds a New York City start-up company. Its not just HTML 5. Its the new Web.But others while also enthusiastic about the changes are more cautious.Most Web users are familiar with so-called cookies which make it possible for example to log on to Web sites without having to retype user names and passwords or to keep track of items placed in virtual shopping carts before they are bought.The new Web language and its additional features present more tracking opportunities because the technology uses a process in which large amounts of data can be collected and stored on the users hard drive while online. Because of that process advertisers and others could experts say see weeks or even months of personal data. That could include a users location time zone photographs text from blogs shopping cart contents e-mails and a history of the Web pages visited.
The new Web language gives trackers one more bucket to put tracking information into said Hakon Wium Lie the chief technology officer at Opera a browser company.Or as Pam Dixon the executive director of the World Privacy Forum in California said: HTML 5 opens Pandoras box of tracking in the Internet.
Representatives from the World Wide Web Consortium say they are taking questions about user privacy very seriously. The organization which oversees the specifications developers turn to for the new Web language will hold a two-day workshop on Internet technologies and privacy.Ian Jacobs head of communications at the consortium said the development process for the new Web language would include a public review. There is accountability he said. This is not a secret cabal for global adoption of these core standards.
The additional capabilities provided by the new Web language are already being put to use by a California programmer who has created what at first glance could be a major new threat to online privacy.Samy Kamkar a California programmer best known in some circles for creating a virus called the Samy Worm which took down MySpace.com in 2005 has created a cookie that is not easily deleted even by experts  something he calls an Evercookie.Some observers call it a supercookie because it stores information in at least 10 places on a computer far more than usually found. It combines traditional tracking tools with new features that come with the new Web language.In creating the cookie Mr. Kamkar has drawn comments from bloggers across the Internet whose descriptions of it range from extremely persistent to horrific.Mr. Kamkar however said he did not create it to violate anyones privacy. He said was curious about how advertisers tracked him on the Internet. After cataloging what he found on his computer he made the Evercookie to demonstrate just how thoroughly peoples computers could be infiltrated by the latest Internet technology.
I think its O.K. for them to say we want to provide better service Mr. Kamkar said of advertisers who placed tracking cookies on his computer. However I should also be able to opt out because it is my computer.
Mr. Kamkar whose 2005 virus circumvented browser safeguards and added more than a million friends to his MySpace page in less than 20 hours said he had no plans to profit from the Evercookie and did not intend to sell it to advertisers.That wouldnt have been difficult he said. Instead he has made the code open to anyone who wants to examine it and says the cookie should be used as a litmus test for preventing tracking.A recent spate of class-action lawsuits have accused large media companies like the Fox Entertainment Group and NBC Universal and technology companies like Clearspring Technologies and Quantcast of violating users privacy by tracking their online activities even after they took steps to prevent that.Most people control their online privacy by adjusting settings in todays most common Web browsers which include Internet Explorer by Microsoft Firefox by Mozilla Safari by Apple and Opera which is used mostly in Europe and Asia and on mobile devices.Each browser has different privacy settings but not all of them have obvious settings for removing data created by the new Web language. Even the most proficient
that deleting that data is tricky and may require multiple steps.Now there are so many sources of data storage its very hard for browser manufacturers to handle that Mr. Cox said.Mr. Kamkar and privacy experts say that makers of Web browsers
should agree on one control for eliminating all tracking capabilities at once. There should be simple enough controls to take care of every single thing said Ms. Dixon who added that some browsers automatically collected large amounts of data unless a user told them not to.
Mr. Lie acknowledged that such companies do have a lot of power. But he said they worry that the privacy settings they develop could be too strict.
For example he said Opera once tried to put more controls on certain types of cookies but users in Russia complained that the controls prevented a popular social networking site from working properly.But software developers and the representatives of the World Wide Web argue that as technology advances consumers have to balance its speed and features against their ability to control their privacy.You can do more but you need to be aware of how your information might be used or misused Mr. Jacobs said. Its the human questions.

That's according to classified documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The dossier published today by ProPublica and The New York Times show the NSA and its Brit counterpart GCHQ were working together on exploiting smartphones in 2007 the same year as the first iPhone launched. The NSA nearly quadrupled its budgets for such monitoring from $204m to $767m that year.
A top-secret report compiled by the NSA shortly after that time boasted the agency had collected so much information from phones running Google's mapping applications that ""you'll be able to clone Google's database."" In 2008 British intelligence reported ""anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system.""
Poorly secured mobile apps have proved to be a ""golden nugget"" according to a May 2010 NSA presentation: harvesting sensitive data sent over public networks by applications is not a problem but it was a little trickier to tag the intercepted information in the agency's XKeyscore database so that analysts could easily pull up a person's records. In the same year a British analyst described the development of smartphone slurping as a ""mobile surge"" comparing it to the surge of US and allied troops into Iraq and Afghanistan.
A 2012 British intelligence document states that the immensely popular Angry Birds game from Finnish developer Rovio had become a useful source thanks to advertising code added by US firm Millennial Media.
Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single married divorced engaged or ""swinger."" This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis we're told.
The documents don't suggest that NSA and GCHQ staffers are directly hacking mobile applications. Instead it's made clear the snoopers are simply skimming and decoding sensitive data the apps collect and transmit back to their developers. One report noted that anyone updating Android on a device will leak about 500 slurpable records describing how the gadget was used by its owner.
NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission the agency said in a statement. Because some data of US persons may at times be incidentally collected in NSA's lawful foreign intelligence mission privacy protections for US persons exist across the entire process with similar protections for innocent foreign citizens.
GCHQ declined to comment on the allegations but said its activities were compliant with today's UK law. Google and Millennial Media havent commented as yet.
Your tinfoil hat is useless  your browser lets spies into your mind
Other Snowden-sourced information published by NBC News today revealed [PDF] that in 2012 GCHQ developed technology code named Squeaky Dolphin to spy on people en masse as they used social networks and other big-name websites.
The British tapped into internet data cables running though the UK and scooped out Facebook Twitter YouTube and Blogger visits to see what's trending online and where hotspots of interest spring up around the world in various topics.
The Human Science Operations Cell also compiled data on what a particular browser choice told them about a user's behavior. Internet Explorer users scored lowest in being open to new experiences but highest in ""agreeableness"" and ""conscientiousness"" while Firefox users are the most neurotic apparently.
But Snowden who gave his first TV interview for German network ARD on Sunday claims that the NSA wasn't above hacking business systems if it felt the information would further US interests. He said that the German manufacturer Siemens was a particular favorite among spies in this regard and that non-key German government targets may also have been infiltrated.
""What I can say is that we know that [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel was monitored by the NSA. But the question is how logical is it that she's the only one who was monitored how likely is it that she was the German person the NSA was watching?"" he said Reuters reports.
""I'd say that it's not very likely that anyone who was watching the German government was only watching Merkel and not her advisers nor other government officials nor ministers heads of industries or even local government officials.""
Snowden said he no longer had any NSA documents himself having passed them all on to journalists around the world. Despite death threats from certain excitable US intelligence operatives Snowden said he was unconcerned for his safety.
""I'm still alive and don't lose sleep for what I did because it was the right thing to do"" he added.

Snapchat breach exposes flawed premise security challenge
A security camera is seen over the door of Snapchat's headquarters in Venice Los Angeles California October 13 2014.
SAN FRANCISCO The prospect of tens of thousands of potentially racy Snapchat photos hitting the Internet has driven home a simple fact: the mobile app's core feature - delivering photos and videos that vanish seconds after viewing - is flawed.The negative publicity surrounding that speculation has spurred criticism about its lax security. But whether this will affect the valuation of the 3-year-old Silicon Valley start-up as it seeks another round of funding remains to be seen.A range of venture capitalists and tech insiders say they believe it will not for now. One person close to the company's fundraising efforts who asked not to be named said Snapchat is still expecting a $10 billion valuation in the current funding round one of the startup industry's richest and the same level being considered by investors before news of the breach surfaced last week.""Once a company is hot investors will be keen to continue investing unless the issue seems to be life-threatening"" said Anand Sanwal chief executive of venture capital consultancy CB Insights. The brouhaha has not yet hurt the popularity of Snapchat among teenagers partly because no mass publication of leaked photos has materialized. The messaging service remained among the five most-downloaded photo and video apps over the weekend according to analytics service App Annie.The issue arose last week when hacker forums claimed unknown parties had created a file holding at least 100000 stolen Snapchat photos including many of minors that could end up being posted online. The anticipated event dubbed ""the snappening"" was widely reported including by Reuters.While Snapchat said its servers were not breached it confirmed that rogue third-party apps have been storing its users' pictures. That points to a longer-term challenge for the Los Angeles company: its inability to fully block the external parties it blames for undermining its business. THE SNAPPENING
Even before any talk of ""the snappening"" security experts were faulting Snapchat for what they call a cavalier approach toward privacy which may have given users a false sense of comfort.The third-party apps which allow users to enter their Snapchat password and log-in information connect to the main service and provide unauthorized features such as image-saving.Such software can be pernicious since the people whose pictures are stored are often unaware of the privacy breach by the downloaders of the third-party apps.Snapchat does not allow other apps to interact with its service but many developers manage to break the rules. The company says it monitors for such ""illegal"" apps and has succeeded in removing some culprits from Google and Apple app stores.One website Snapsaved.com claimed on Monday on its Facebook page that its servers had been hacked and that intruders had accessed its trove of Snapshot photos.
""Any application that isn't ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can't be trusted"" Snapchat warned in a Tuesday blogpost.But Snapchat should have been able to detect multiple requests for information originating from external services or to detect when users were alternately logging on from different apps cybersecurity experts said.In addition Snapchat used very elementary encryption to protect photos and videos on its service said Chris Wysopal
chief technology officer of Veracode a firm specializing in testing apps for security vulnerabilities.Instead of requiring two separate cryptographic keys to access images transmitted across Snapchat the service relied on a single universal key that unlocked everything ""the bare minimum"" he said.
""Someone who knew what they were doing probably in a few hours could reverse-engineer it find the key and write a program to decrypt the photos as they go over the network.""In May Snapchat settled charges with U.S. regulators accusing it of deceiving customers by promising that photos on its service disappeared forever. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also faulted Snapchat for storing unencrypted videos on users' phones which could be accessed by connecting the device to a personal computer.Still even the best security measures could leave Snapchat playing an unwinnable cat-and-mouse game with hackers. At a very basic level Snapchat cannot stop anyone from taking a photo of a photo. Anyone who receives a Snapchat image on the phone can use another camera to capture the screen picture said Michael Coates director of product security at Shape Security.Still Snapchat may have little to worry in the near term at least on the valuation front industry insiders say.David Cowan a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners which has not invested in Snapchat but has backed other consumer startups like dating service Zoosk and online bulletin board Pinterest said Snapchat has little to worry about.
""These types of breaches will definitely stop people from using Snapchat"" Cowan said ""until they have a really cool picture to share.""

pri_250_db,whsmith accidentally emailed customer personal det.txt,"WHSmith appears to have suffered a data privacy breach - Business Insider
People are freaking out because WHSmith is accidentally emailing customer contact details to other customers
On Wednesday morning many WHSmith customersstarted receiving hundreds of emails containing personal details forthe company's other customers. It appears that every time someone used WHSmith's contact form their message is then sent to its entire mailing list.
Some of the early emails contained sensitive information like full names and telephone numbers.
Anyone else getting dozens of emails via @WHSmith contact form ? Including phone numbers pic.twitter.com/960EZYNSSE  Lynn Schreiber
Unfortunate that every time someone emails @WHSmith about magazine subscriptions it's going to *everyone* on the database. Details too.		 Jono Read
Seriously @WHSmith - 18 emails containing other peoples details and still counting......		 Rob Weatherhead
It appears that for a few hours WHSmith only hid the contact form rather than removing it.
props to @WHSmith for their quick incident response removing the broken form from thei... oh wait pic.twitter.com/AGrYNRkoE1  Alice Maz
When people started to realise what was happening they went to the company's contact form to make a complaint. But this meant that other customers received copies of those emails too.
While some people were understandably worried that their personal information is being sent to the inboxes of hundreds of strangers others used the bug to send very public messages tofriends family and WHSmith itself.

One even took advantage of the situation to ask the company for a job.

Some customers managed to get through to WHSmith but continued to receive them emails.
Just spoke to @WHSmith - they are aware of and sorry for data breach. I'm still receiving private details of strangers #whsmithfail.		 Ke Day
WHSmith has now released a statement to the Guardian which puts the huge breach down to a ""bug"" in the system used to processes its magazine subscriptions. The company says this process is managed by yet another company.
The statement said: We have been alerted to a systems processing bug by I-subscribe who manage our magazine subscriptions. It is a bug not a data breach. We believe that this has impacted fewer than 40 customers who left a message on the Contact Us page where this bug was identified that has resulted in some customers receiving emails this morning that have been misdirected in error.
I-subscribe have immediately taken down their Contact Us online form which contains the identified bug while this is resolved. I-subscribe are contacting the customers concerned to apologise for this administrative processing error. We can confirm that this issue has not impacted or compromised any customer passwords or payment details and we apologise to the customers concerned.
A WHSmith Magazines spokeswoman told Business Insider on Wednesday that the problem was down to a technical issue that the IT department was looking into and hoped to resolve soon. The spokeswoman confirmed that customers that are on the company's mailing list for magazine subscriptions were being forwarded the emails from its online contact form.

Timmy Kimbrough at home with his daughter Josie 2 and his stepdaughters Nicole 13 and Brooke Borden 10 left. His wife shown in the framed photograph is in jail.
On a rainy day just after Thanksgiving Amanda Kimbrough played with her 2-year-old daughter in her raw-wood-paneled living room petting her terriers and half-watching TV. Kimbrough who is 32 lives a few miles outside Russellville a town of fewer than 10000 in rural northwestern Alabama near the border of Franklin and Colbert Counties. Textiles were the economic engine of the area until the 1990s when the industry went into decline and mills shut down. Now one of the regions leading employers is Pilgrims a chicken supplier. The median household income is $31213 and more than a third of children live below the poverty line.
As family members came in and out of the room and one daytime show slid into another  The Peoples Court Intervention Jerry Springer The Ellen DeGeneres Show  Kimbrough talked about her arrest following the death of her third child Timmy Jr. Born premature at 25 weeks on April 29 2008 Timmy Jr. weighed 2 pounds 1 ounce and lived only 19 minutes. When Kimbrough tested positive for methamphetamine her two daughters were swiftly removed from her custody and for 90 days she was allowed only supervised visits. Social services mandated parenting classes and drug treatment.
Heather Capps 25 and her 5-month-old son Malice at a halfway house in Albertville Ala. She was arrested after her son tested positive for Oxycodone.
That would have been a typical response in most places but Alabama is different. Six months after Timmy Jr.s death the district attorney in Colbert County charged Kimbrough with chemical endangerment of a child a Class A felony (because the infant died) that carries a mandatory sentence of 10 years to life. She turned herself in and bail was set at $250000. At the trial the state completed its case in two days. On the advice of her lawyer Kimbrough then pleaded guilty and received the minimum sentence of 10 years.According to Kyle Brown the chief assistant district attorney in the case Kimbrough might have received far more time if a jury had found her guilty. She caused the death of another person Angela Hulsey an assistant district attorney on the case said a person that will never have the chance to go to school go to the prom get married have children of their own. Youre dealing with the most innocent of victims.When I met Kimbrough last fall she was free on an appeal bond. (Her plea bargain allows her lawyers to appeal her conviction on constitutional grounds without contesting the specifics of her case.) Kimbrough said she never had a big problem with meth but admitted that she started using the drug in her mid-20s after her first marriage collapsed. When she was pregnant with Timmy Jr. she did meth only once she told me.One time she said. I dont even know why I done it. I guess the Devil knocked on my shoulder that day. Otherwise Kimbrough insisted she abstained from drugs during her pregnancy even refusing painkillers for an infected tooth for fear they would hurt the baby. Timmy Jr.s birth had many potentially complicating factors including prematurity and a prolapsed cord. Kimbrough says she was eager to have the child  she had always wanted a boy. She and her husband Timmy Sr. were told at an early-April prenatal visit that Timmy Jr. would likely have Down syndrome and while abortion was an option the Kimbroughs who oppose abortion on moral grounds did not consider it. We didnt care if he was special needs Timmy Sr. said. We would have loved him.
Kimbrough told me that she was devastated by the loss of her baby and scared of being locked up. She described a recent visit to her brother in prison where he is serving time for burglary and other charges and how upset she was by the place.I feel for people on drugs she continued. You got to stay away from people thats on them. I learned that in rehab and I been clean ever since. I feel like I iced the cake with this one. To me losing a child. . . .  She stared off into space.Kimbroughs cheerful 10-year-old Brooke arrived home from school shaking the rain off her coat and chatting about a new necklace. In quick succession Kimbrough checked Brookes backpack for new library books fixed peanut-butter crackers and braided a dolls hair. She has to take care of everybody her adult stepdaughter Amy told me. Shes a mother hen.You might not expect a rural Alabama mother with a felony conviction to have in her corner a national army of feminists civil libertarians and gynecologists but Kimbroughs case has attracted the interest of groups like Planned Parenthood the A.C.L.U. and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who all maintain that her conviction sets a dangerous precedent. Emma Ketteringham the director of legal advocacy at the National Advocates for Pregnant Women a New York-based reproductive-justice group has been following Kimbroughs case closely. She has drafted friend of the court briefs for Kimbrough signed by groups like the National Organization for Women-Alabama and the American Medical Association. She argues that applying Alabamas chemical-endangerment law to pregnant women violates constitutional guarantees of liberty privacy equality due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. In effect she says under Alabamas chemical-endangerment law pregnant women have become a special class of people that should be treated differently from every other citizen. And she says the law violates pregnant womens constitutional rights to equal protection under the law. Ketteringham also recruited two prominent Alabama lawyers Jake Watson and Brian M. White to take Kimbroughs case pro bono. I love babies too but I dont like locking up their mamas Watson told me.There have been approximately 60 chemical-endangerment prosecutions of new mothers in Alabama since 2006 the year the statute was enacted. Originally created to protect children from potentially explosive meth labs Alabamas chemical-endangerment law prohibits a responsible person from exposing a child to an environment in which he or she . . . knowingly recklessly or intentionally causes or permits a child to be exposed to to ingest or inhale or to have contact with a controlled substance chemical substance or drug paraphernalia.Criminal convictions of women for their newborns positive drug tests are rare in other states lawyers familiar with these cases say. In most places maternal drug use is considered a matter for child protective services not for law enforcement. Advocates for Kimbrough insist that in any case Alabamas chemical-endangerment law was never meant to apply to pregnant womens drug use. The words womb uterus pregnant women dont appear in the law Ketteringham says. It was a law meant to protect children from meth labs. One state legislator has filed an amicus brief claiming the law was not intended to be used this way and the Legislature has repeatedly rejected amendments to expand the laws definition of child to explicitly mean fetus. But shortly after the law passed Alabama prosecutors began extending the term environment to also mean the womb and child to also mean fetus. In 2006 Tiffany Hitson was charged with chemical endangerment the day after she gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for cocaine and marijuana but was otherwise healthy. When that prosecution was successful (Hitson was incarcerated for a year) other counties followed suit making Alabama the national capital for prosecuting women on behalf of their newborn children.
Last summer the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld this expanded interpretation of the chemical-endangerment law ruling that the dictionary definition of child includes unborn child an interpretation that will be challenged when the states Supreme Court considers Kimbroughs case in the coming months. But the implications of that ruling go far beyond Alabama. Critics like Ketteringham argue that Alabamas chemical-endangerment law offers a back door into what has become known as the fetal personhood argument.Personhood USA an organization based in Colorado was founded in 2008 by Keith Mason after he became frustrated by the mainstream anti-abortion movements incremental approach of restricting the availability of legal abortion. From my perspective I saw a movement that was largely dying or dead and had a lack of enthusiasm from younger people and from people who had been in the fight for so many years he told me. Something had to change. Personhood is that rallying point because its the crux of the issue. His movement seeks to establish the fetuss right to live as equal to that of the mothers.Personhood advocates regard fetal rights as a civil rights issue and they often compare themselves to abolitionists. I think it would be unequal protection to give the woman a pass when anyone else who injects drugs into a child would be prosecuted Ben DuPr director of Personhood Alabama said. What it boils down to is arent these little children persons?The goal of Personhood USA is to establish that a fully rights-endowed person is created when sperm meets egg. To that end it has introduced initiatives and measures in legislatures in 22 states. Though none of these measures have become law some like Proposition 26 in Mississippi have made it to a ballot referendum and other measures have passed legislative chambers in North Dakota Montana and Oklahoma. The problem with those measures from a legal perspective says Lynn Paltrow executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women is that there is no way to treat fertilized eggs embryos and fetuses as separate constitutional persons without subtracting pregnant women from the community of constitutional persons.The sometimes vague language of the initiatives and measures masks what would be the sweeping effects on access to health care says Alexa Kolbi-Molinas a staff lawyer for the A.C.L.U.s Reproductive Freedom Project. One district-court judge agreed with the A.C.L.U. which brought a suit to block a personhood initiative from the ballot in Nevada. Judge James E. Wilson ordered the sponsor of the states personhood initiative to add clarifying language. As he wrote in his opinion in December: The initiative would protect a prenatal person regardless of whether or not the prenatal person would live grow or develop in the womb or survive birth; prevent all abortions even in the case of rape incest or serious threats to the womans health or life or when a woman is suffering from a miscarriage or as an emergency treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. . . . The initiative was withdrawn but signatures are being gathered on a rewritten petition.
In Mississippi Proposition 26 would have outlawed abortion embryonic-stem-cell research cancer treatments that might hurt a fetus and some popular methods of birth control. The measure was defeated Paltrow said because its implication was obvious: once the woman becomes pregnant she has a second-class status in which she loses virtually every constitutional right including a right to medical privacy.At least Mississippi put it up to a vote Ketteringham says. In Alabama you essentially have a personhood measure in disguise.Critics of Alabamas chemical-endangerment law argue that drug use by pregnant women is best treated as a health issue not a criminal one. Addiction they say can be treated but drug users have to be willing to seek help which they might be less likely to do if they fear arrest. To simplify a complex medical and psychosocial issue into a criminal issue is really just like using a hammer to play the piano says Dr. Deborah Frank a pediatrician and director of Boston Medical Centers Grow Clinic for Children. The whole definition of addiction is compulsive behavior in spite of adverse consequences  like the person who keeps eating doughnuts even though their doctor tells them theyre morbidly obese and going to die of a heart attack. Deterrents experts like Frank say dont work well when it comes to addicts and may even be counterproductive.Heather Capps a 25-year-old mother of three was arrested in Marshall County Ala. on Nov. 11 2011 two days after giving birth via Caesarean section to a healthy boy who tested positive for Oxycodone. Capps says that she became addicted to the drug after it was prescribed for her scoliosis pain. When Capps learned she was pregnant she knew she would be prosecuted if she gave birth to a baby who tested positive for drugs and she also knew that the effects of withdrawal from quitting abruptly during pregnancy could be dangerous to her unborn child.She went online and after finding the Web site of National Advocates for Pregnant Women called Ketteringham to ask for legal advice. Ketteringham confirmed that if Capps gave birth in Marshall County she would most likely be prosecuted and recommended that she hire a lawyer. Capps had heard that prosecutors in nearby Jefferson County werent bringing chemical-endangerment charges against drug-using pregnant women but because she had two young sons in school she decided to stay where she was and to continue taking the lowest possible dose of Oxycodone she felt she could manage. She also posted some regrettable things during private Facebook conversations: I figured since I was just informed that im a crackhead (still wonderin how im the last to find out) and pregnant now ill just shoot thru my belly button strait into the uterus to make sure the baby gets high to. That Facebook post shown on the local news after her arrest made her a pariah. Her family insists the post was a cry for help. When she was told there was no help for her and that she might lose the baby she was petrified her husband Matthew Devin says. She couldnt live with herself if she hurt one of our kids.
Capps was arrested on the hospital grounds. She remained in jail for three months because her family could not afford to post her $500000 bail. She was then sent to rehab and placed in a halfway house where she continues to receive treatment. If she completes the program to the judges satisfaction her sentence will be dismissed. She is allowed to see her three children once a week on Sundays.The recommended treatment for opiate addiction during pregnancy is a controlled dosage of methadone says Dr. Robert Newman of the International Center for Advancement of Addiction Treatment at Beth Israel who says a prognosis for both mother and baby is good with long-term outpatient treatment. (Capps told me that the drug treatment she was offered while pregnant was at an inpatient facility in Birmingham.) Prosecutors I spoke with said they would not charge a woman taking prescribed methadone. But the law does not prohibit such a charge and critics argue that the threat of prosecution discourages women from seeking addiction treatment. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement in 2011 cautioning that women would even avoid prenatal care when they believed doctors were gathering evidence for law enforcement. Measures like Alabamas chemical-endangerment law they said are contrary to the welfare of the mother and fetus. State Senator Clay Scofield of Alabama who is seeking to amend the states chemical-endangerment law to include the fetus dismisses this concern. The majority of women who are abusing meth already do not seek prenatal care he told me.There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that pregnant women in Alabama aware that they may be arrested and their medical records subpoenaed if they or their babies test positive for drugs may be changing their behavior  although not necessarily as some prosecutors hoped. Carmen Howell a defense lawyer in Enterprise says she knows of one woman who drove to Georgia when she went into labor and another who gave birth to a three-pound baby in a bathtub at home. She is concerned that women who use drugs may also be having abortions to avoid prosecution. This law she says is a deterrent to choosing life.Last November I accompanied Kimbrough and Timmy Sr. to Timmy Jr.s grave in a well-tended cemetery near Kimbroughs parents house. Kimbroughs grandfather was buried nearby; a gravestone portrait shows him driving a John Deere tractor. It was raining and Kimbrough shivering in a black turtleneck and jeans rearranged metal butterflies ceramic angels and a plastic cross until Timmy Sr. called out from their truck Are you trying to get a cold?The funeral had been small. We only done close family Kimbrough had told me earlier. I had a closed casket for my older kids cause he was so purple. I think about it every day. To me thats punishment enough.Dont upset yourself now Timmy Sr. said. He pushed back his slicked-back hair revealing an upper-arm tattoo of a cross above which is written Amanda.
People look to her real bad he said. I dont know why they want to make out like she done it on purpose or something. Us losing it and all was enough for me and her both. Them wanting to send her to prison for it that just aint right. Timmy Sr. who is 22 years older than his wife and whom she affectionately calls Bro told me that he once had trouble with meth too. But he said he did a 180 when he met Kimbrough. I been to rehab he said. Its a disease.Back at home Kimbrough went into her bedroom and came out with a white box containing knitted socks and an imprint of Timmy Jr.s foot on paper. Neatly folded in a bag labeled with his birth date was Timmy Jr.s hospital blanket decorated with a teddy-bear angel. There was one nurse who sat and talked to me Kimbrough said. She was the only one who was really good to me. When they brought the baby in there they acted like I didnt hold him long enough. Who wants to hold a dead baby you know? she continued apologetically. I held him for about 10 minutes.
When I drove up to the address that Hope Ankrom gave me I assumed I must have entered it incorrectly into the cars GPS. It was a palatial house in an upscale community with an 18-hole golf course. Ankrom was one of the first women to be prosecuted under Alabamas chemical-endangerment law. Most women against whom chemical-endangerment charges are brought are poor defense lawyers say. But Ankroms husband is an aircraft mechanic who makes six figures working as a contractor in Afghanistan. This house which belongs to Ankroms parents a retired Army colonel and a nurse is about a five-hour drive south of Kimbroughs home and probably worth 10 times as much.
Chemical endangerment of a child in the case of death is a Class A felony in Alabama carrying a mandatory sentence of 10 years to life.
At 29 Ankrom seems like a mischievous teenager. She wore dangly silver earrings a brown T-shirt jeans and boots. Her three children (Bryson now 3; Aubree 4; and Paige 5) raced around the living room in a blur of curly dark hair and sippy cups. She yelled at Bryson to come back from the open front door and helped Paige change from flip-flops to sneakers then shooed all three children out the door to accompany their grandfather to McDonalds.Listen: silence she said with a smile. Bryson she told me was born weighing almost six pounds. He was healthy but tested positive for marijuana and cocaine. Ankrom admits smoking pot but denies cocaine use. She said that she quit smoking pot for her first two pregnancies but that during the third her morning sickness was relentless. Marijuana kept her functional she said and so she continued in spite of her gynecologists warning that she faced prosecution if she did not stop. She planned to quit a few weeks before her due date assuming that she would then test negative. But Bryson came six weeks early.When Brysons drug-test results came back the hospital called the Department of Human Resources Alabamas child-protection service which placed her children in the custody of her parents. The first night without my children I thought I was just going to die Ankrom said. She moved in with her parents so she could be around her children but she was not allowed to be alone with them.
Two weeks later the police came to the door with a warrant.Since I was breast-feeding they let me pump a few times before they took me to jail Ankrom said. They handcuffed her walked her to the car in front of her parents neighbors and then took her to a holding cell where she spent a few hours before her parents posted bail. Boy did I leak while I was in there! she said with a laugh. I had toilet paper crammed in my bra. There is nothing more painful than needing to express and not being able to.For several months Ankrom received regular unannounced spot checks to make sure she wasnt alone with any of her children. A friend moved in to supervise her when her parents werent home. Ankrom pleaded guilty to chemical endangerment and was given a suspended sentence with one years probation. She completed mandatory drug treatment and continues to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings for what she describes as a marijuana addiction. I really screwed up she said. I cant blame anybody but myself.Ankrom now stays home with the children full time. Even if they dont need the money she said she wishes she could work. But the guilty plea has made that more difficult. Whats killing me is I had a bright future said Ankrom who was studying to be a physical-therapy assistant. When you want to work with children or the elderly they see that abuse charge and theyre like: Whoa no thank you maam. Youre not going to work here. Ankrom said she had little expectation that her circumstances would change though Alabamas Supreme Court will hear her case along with Kimbroughs. Im not holding my breath on the Supreme Court overturning it she said. I am guilty. I did smoke pot. I made bad decisions. She shrugged. It is how it is.Ankroms lawyer Carmen Howell who represented her before the Court of Criminal Appeals (which upheld Ankroms and Kimbroughs convictions this past summer) is pressing on with the appeal pro bono because she said the implications of the law are scary. She questioned what the arrest was really about if Ankrom could be prosecuted for drug use even though her child was unharmed.I think what youre looking at here is a failure to understand that addiction is a disease of the brain says Dr. Barry Lester the director of the Center for the Study of Children at Risk at Brown University. You are looking at people who think that these are horrible women who are rationally willfully hurting their kids but its more complicated than that. Science has shown that addiction is a disease like any other mental illness and absolutely treatable.
Prosecutors often compare doing drugs while pregnant to driving while drunk. A crime has still been committed they say even when there is no harm done. Mitch Floyd a passionate 42-year-old from Albertville  part of an area known as Meth Mountain  has prosecuted chemical-endangerment cases against new mothers more aggressively than anyone else. He is a patient friendly man with light eyes who becomes deadly serious when he talks about babies.
Addiction is a very powerful force he told me. However theres a force thats more powerful than that to me and that is a child is helpless and God has put one person on this planet to be the last-line defense to be the fiercest protector of that child and that is its mother. My wife would literally claw someones eyes out  fight you to the death for our children. I mean thats just what mothers are supposed to do. When that childs ultimate protector is the one causing the harm what do you do?Over breakfast at a hotel restaurant in Florence Ala. he shared photos of babies involved in some of his cases. Many looked healthy although he said they were tiny and had all been exposed to drugs. One born in February 2007 was shown in a neonatal-intensive-care unit with a mans wedding ring hanging around her wrist like a bangle. Another born in August 2008 was dead and purple his hands crossed over his chest.I meant to take that one out he said.Floyd says he is committed to drug-abuse prevention because through his own work as an assistant district attorney and that of his wife who works for the Department of Human Resources he has seen firsthand the devastation of drugs on families. He visits local high schools and community groups to encourage teenagers to stay off meth and insists the primary goal of these chemical-endangerment prosecutions is to keep more babies from being exposed to drugs. The mothers who are convicted he says are put in rehab and helped in the long run. Its a shame that babies need to be protected from their own mothers but sometimes they do and thats our job Floyd said. It upsets me and offends me at the same time.People can argue with it he added referring to his chemical-endangerment prosecutions but I think weve been very successful. We want folks to not reoffend to get clean to get reunited. I think thats the best-case scenario.No one would suggest that pregnant women should use drugs. But there are scientists who say that methamphetamines do not have a long-term impact on a developing fetus. Dr. Carl L. Hart an associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute says that heavy alcohol use is potentially far more serious than a mothers use of opiates cocaine or meth because while these harder drugs may result in preterm labor or withdrawal symptoms that need to be managed few babies experience long-term effects. Babies with fetal-alcohol syndrome by contrast are likely to have lifelong physical mental and emotional issues including significantly delayed brain development.Furthermore attributing a babys medical condition to the presence of a single drug can be difficult because many women who use illegal drugs have other risk factors at play during their pregnancies. Poor nutrition smoking drinking homelessness poverty. . . . How do you control for all that? Dr. Stephen Kandall a neonatologist and the author of Substance and Shadow: Women and Addiction in the United States told me.
Floyds message however is clear and uncomplicated: drug use during pregnancy is dangerous and criminal. In January he announced he would run for Marshall County district judge and campaigned in the Republican primary in part on his chemical-endangerment prosecutions. One ad featured a local obstetrician praising Floyds work on behalf of the countys children born and unborn. Floyd the doctor says makes sure these women are jailed and the babies are placed in a safe home. Another ad showed a woman named Whitney Holsonback holding her baby and smiling. Mitch Floyd made sure I went to jail it read but allowed me to go to drug treatment. With his help she says in the ad she was able to turn her life around. Now shes off drugs in nursing school and able to be a good mother to her son. Mitch was tough on me she says but he also cared about me; he encouraged me.On March 13 Floyd won in a landslide.Laws concerning a pregnant womans treatment of her fetus are not without precedent. Since abortion was legalized in 1973 hundreds of women across the country have been arrested for harming their fetuses with charges ranging from child endangerment to first-degree murder.Many of these prosecutions originate in laws initially designed to build in extra penalties when pregnant women are victims of a crime. Fetal-homicide laws for example which are on the books in 39 states have often been passed in response to a brutal killing. Alabamas fetal-homicide law is known as the Brody Bill named after the fetus who died in the 2005 murder of his mother Brandy Parker. But treating women and their fetuses as separate persons under the law can have unexpected consequences. A woman in Indiana Bei Bei Shuai is now in prison for a suicide attempt that resulted in the death of her fetus. Three years ago in Mississippi Rennie Gibbs had a stillbirth shortly after turning 16. When her baby tested positive for cocaine she was charged with a depraved heart murder the legal term for a killing with a callous disregard for human life which in Mississippi carries a life sentence without possibility of parole until the age of 65. The Mississippi State Supreme Court after initially agreeing to weigh in on the case abruptly reconsidered saying Gibbs should stand trial before it would rule on whether the law applies to pregnant women. Alabamas fetal-homicide law exempts pregnant women.Measures that specifically define fetuses as persons have failed in every state in which they have been introduced (Colorado voters rejected fetal-personhood initiatives twice) but Mason the founder of Personhood USA told me that he isnt deterred. The goal he said is to raise awareness much as gay marriage advocates with whom he disagrees have done with their campaigns. The more we raise the issue the more we change the culture he said. Troy Newman president of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue agrees in part saying: Is it a winning strategy? Obviously not. Theyve spent millions of dollars in at least two different states running initiatives and theyve all failed miserably. On the other hand laws like chemical endangerment he says could ultimately get the anti-abortion movement where it wants to go. Look he says we win every time we establish the precedent that the unborn child in the womb is a unique human individual.
Mathew D. Staver the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel who helped get fetal personhood on the ballot in Mississippi recently filed an amicus brief with the State Supreme Court supporting the states case against Ankrom. Staver told me by phone that its clear that history has sided with the idea that life begins in the womb. The only aberration is Roe v. Wade. Abortion laws are an island unto themselves and that island is gradually shrinking.But the expansion of fetal-homicide and chemical-endangerment laws have some people on the other side of the debate reaching for their copies of The Handmaids Tale Margaret Atwoods dystopian novel in which women are enslaved as childbearers.Were heading toward this Margaret Atwood-like society Ketteringham says. The idea that the state needs to threaten and punish women so that they do the right thing during pregnancy is appalling. Everyone talks about the personhood of the fetus but whats really at stake is the personhood of women. It starts with the use of an illegal drug but what happens as a consequence of that precedent is that everything a woman does while shes pregnant becomes subject to state regulation.It starts with cocaine and then its cigarettes and alcohol. How much alcohol? And when? Its only a matter of time until it comes to refusing a bed-rest order because you need to work and take care of your other children and then you have a miscarriage. What if you stay at a job where youre exposed to toxic chemicals as at a dry cleaner? What if you keep taking your S.S.R.I.s during pregnancy? If a woman is told that sex during her pregnancy could be a risk to the fetus and the woman has sex anyway and miscarries are you going to prosecute the woman  and the man too?[The fetus] is another human being just like we are Scofield the state senator says. I look at the tens of millions of good mothers who make the right decisions. My mother for instance smoked forever. The day she found out she was pregnant with me she put down her cigarettes for the last time. If we turn our back on this we say to all these good mothers who have made good decisions that its meaningless to society to be a good mother or a good father.
Despite the mother-hen domesticity I witnessed Amanda Kimbrough has not proved to be a model test-case defendant. Three months after I met her in Russellville she was back in jail. Her appeal bond was revoked when she was charged with selling Oxycodone to a confidential informant. Timmy Sr. called the arrest a setup. David Henry Neal the lawyer representing her on the new charge said he would enter a not-guilty plea if there was an indictment. We just hope that the system will not try to get its pound of flesh over the death of the infant through the new drug charge says Brian White one of her lawyers in the chemical-endangerment case.But an investigator in the Franklin County sheriffs office who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak to the press told me that his office had been monitoring Kimbrough for a long time: The important thing is the safety of the kids. Shes not an innocent person if shes already in trouble and done that to her baby and shes still out selling dope.Her lawyers were clearly disappointed by the new arrest but given their experience working with defendants not entirely surprised. No case is ever easy Ketteringham told me. People are complicated. Kimbroughs drug history her lawyers acknowledge may make it difficult to sympathize with her. But they say moral outrage need not be accompanied by legal punishment. Maybe human beings have not evolved enough to hold the complex idea that many things can be true at the same time Paltrow of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women says. We can feel a certain way. We can value the unborn as a matter of religion ethics or experience but we cant do that as a matter of law and still value pregnant women.

EFF hits Google for removing 'vital privacy feature' with Android 4.4.2
The new Android update disables a feature that allowed users to revoke permissions for installed apps
The Android 4.4.2 update that began to roll out Monday to Google's Nexus devices removed a feature that gave users fine-grained control over app permissions prompting criticism from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.The removed feature was called App Ops and was introduced in Android 4.3. It provided an interface from where users could withdraw permissions they gave apps when installing them. Traditionally Android users have had to choose between giving an app all permissions it requests or not use it.The granular permission control provided by App Ops is something that privacy advocates have long requested since many apps ask for more permissions than they need to provide their main functionality.In part this is because a lot of apps especially free ones bundle advertising libraries that provide a revenue stream for developers. Often the excessive permissions requested by such apps come from those ad libraries. Last week Goldenshores Technologies the developer of a popular flashlight app for Android settled U.S. Federal Trade Commission charges that it shared users' geolocation information with advertising networks without properly notifying users. The company agreed to disclose to users how it collects uses and shares geolocation information and obtain consent from them before doing so.While present inside Android 4.3 the App Ops interface has never been directly accessible to users but it was easy to gain access to it by installing third-party applications like Permission Manager or AppOps Launcher from Google Play.In a blog post Wednesday the Electronic Frontier Foundation a digital rights watchdog called App Ops an ""awesome"" feature and a ""huge advance in Android privacy."" However the organization's enthusiasm was short lived as some users later pointed out that Google removed the feature in Android 4.4.2.""Today we installed that update to our test device and can confirm that the App Ops privacy feature that we were excited about yesterday is in fact now gone"" Peter Eckersley EFF's director of technology projects said Thursday in a separate blog post. ""The disappearance of App Ops is alarming news for Android users"" Eckersley said. ""The fact that they cannot turn off app permissions is a Stygian hole in the Android security model and a billion people's data is being sucked through. Embarrassingly it is also one that Apple managed to fix in iOS years ago.""According to Eckersley when contacted by the EFF Google said the feature wasn't supposed to be released to begin with because it was experimental and its use could break some apps.The EFF feels this explanation is suspicious and believes that Google should have worked to improve it rather than remove it. The problem of apps breaking down when not given access to information like location data the address book or the phone's IMEI (equipment identifier) number could be solved by supplying those apps with dummy data when the corresponding permission is removed Eckersley said.Google declined to comment.The company reportedly tried to block access to App Ops before with the initial release of Android 4.4 KitKat but developers figured out how to enable it again.EFF urged Google to re-enable the App Ops interface and improve it. The interface should be properly integrated into the Settings interface Android users should be able to disable all collection of trackable identifiers with a single switch and should have a way to disable an app's network access entirely Eckersley said.""There are numerous ways to make App Ops work for developers"" he said. ""Pick one and deploy it.""Android 4.4.2 also patches two denial-of-service issues including one involving class 0 (Flash SMS) messages that was disclosed at a security conference at the beginning on December. Bogdan Alecu the mobile security researcher who found the Flash SMS vulnerability confirmed Friday that it was fixed in the new Android version.Users are now in a difficult situation because they will have to choose between updating to the new version which removes the App Ops privacy feature or not updating and leaving their devices vulnerable Eckersley said.

Apps for Children Fall Short on Disclosure to Parents Report Says
Several hundred of the most popular educational and gaming mobile apps for children fail to give parents basic explanations about what kinds of personal information the apps collect from children who can see that data and what they use it for a new federal report says.
The apps often transmit the phone number precise location or unique serial code of a mobile device to app developers advertising networks or other companies according to the report by the Federal Trade Commission released Monday. Regulators said such information could be used to find or contact children or track their activities across different apps without their parents knowledge or consent.The agency reviewed 400 of the most popular childrens apps available on Google and Apple platforms and reported that only 20 percent disclosed their data collection practices.
F.T.C. Moves to Tighten Online Privacy Protections for ChildrenSEPT. 27 2012
The survey results described in this report paint a disappointing picture of the privacy protections provided by apps for children the report said.
Jessica Rich associate director of the F.T.C. division of financial practices.
Regulators said they were investigating whether the practices of certain apps violated a federal law requiring Web site operators to get parents permission before collecting or sharing names phone numbers addresses or other personal information obtained from children under 13.The report comes as the agency is preparing to strengthen those protections by requiring site operators to obtain parental consent before collecting many other kinds of personal information from children.But over the last few months the agencys efforts have met with pushback from Apple Facebook Google and Viacom as well as from technology associations and marketing industry groups who say the agencys proposed solution is so broad that it could inhibit companies from offering sites apps and other services for children.In its report the agency did not disclose the names of apps it found problems with.We think this is a systematic problem said Jessica Rich the associate director of the F.T.C.s division of financial practices adding that parents should not think if they avoid certain apps they are home free.
Representatives of the app industry said they had already been working with app developers to make disclosures about data collection clearer and simpler for consumers. But the F.T.C. report is a reminder that there is more work to do said Jon Potter the president of the Application Developers Alliance an industry group.
James Steyer the head of Common Sense Media said the federal law protecting childrens privacy needed major revisions.

The agencys researchers also reported that most apps failed to tell parents when they involved interactive features like advertising social network sharing or allowing children to make purchases for virtual goods within the app.For instance researchers found that 58 percent of the childrens apps contained ads even though just 15 percent disclosed this before download. Moreover of the 24 apps that stated they did not contain in-app advertising 10 did contain ads the report said.Childrens advocates said the reports findings reinforced the need to strengthen online privacy protections for children. The agency has not substantially revised its regulations based on the federal Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act or Coppa since the laws introduction more than a decade ago.
This makes the case as to why we need major revisions said James Steyer the chief executive of Common Sense Media a nonprofit advocacy and education group in San Francisco that focuses on children and technology. It shows that parents dont have enough information to make good choices.The timing of the report suggests that the agency is trying to lay the groundwork for its push for broader childrens online privacy protections. In interviews agency officials have said the protections needed to be modernized to keep pace with developments in mobile apps voice recognition facial recognition and comprehensive online data collection by marketers.
For example regulators have proposed a longer list of data about children that would require parental consent for Web site operators to collect including photos voice recordings and unique mobile device serial numbers. Agency officials have also emphasized that they considered the precise location of a mobile device to be personal information whose collection required parental permission.

By Fritzie Andrade Emily B. Hager David Gillen and Pedro Rafael Rosado on
If the agency includes these changes in the final version of its updated regulations apps would need to get parental consent for a number of data collection practices that are in widespread use.For example agency researchers reported that almost 60 percent of the childrens apps in the study transmitted a devices ID number most commonly to an advertising network or another third party. But only 20 percent of the apps disclosed information about these kinds of practices. Regulators said their concern was that marketers or other entities could use these unique device numbers to follow individual children across multiple apps over time compiling detailed dossiers on their activities.The transmission of kids information to third parties that are invisible and unknown to parents raises concerns the report said.Although state and federal regulators along with industry groups have been working to improve disclosures for consumers about how mobile apps collect and use their data progress has been incremental.Kamala D. Harris the attorney general of California signed an agreement this year with seven leading app platforms to make sure apps available through their stores displayed privacy policies. She also recently sent letters to 100 companies whose apps she said did not comply with a California law requiring them to post privacy policies.Last week Ms. Harriss office sued Delta Air Lines for not warning users of its Fly Delta app that it collected personal information like a users full name phone number e-mail address photographs and location.
App industry associations have also been working to improve transparency for consumers and parents. For instance the Application Developers Alliance in a joint project with the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups has created prototype disclosure notices that apps could voluntarily display before consumers download them.I think the app industry continues to work with our members companies and consumer groups to identify and eventually implement more effective ways of communicating with consumers said Mr. Potter the president of the app developers group.Ms. Rich of the Federal Trade Commission said she hoped the agencys report would light a fire under such efforts. She added that the agency intended to conduct studies regularly on the childrens app market and publicly report its findings.

Technology|Code That Tracks Users Browsing Prompts Lawsuits
Sandra Person Burns used to love browsing and shopping online. Until she realized she was being tracked by software on her computer that she thought she had erased.
Ms. Person Burns 67 a retired health care executive who lives in Jackson Miss. said she is wary of online shopping: Instead of going to Amazon Im going to the local bookstore.Ms. Person Burns is one of a growing number of consumers who are taking legal action against companies that track computer users activity on the Internet. At issue is a little-known piece of computer code placed on hard drives by the Flash program from Adobe when users watch videos on popular Web sites like YouTube and Hulu.The technology so-called Flash cookies is bringing an increasing number of federal lawsuits against media and technology companies and growing criticism from some privacy advocates who say the software may also allow the companies to create detailed profiles of consumers without their knowledge.Unlike other so-called HTML cookies which store Web site preferences and can be managed by changing privacy settings in a Web browser Flash cookies are stored in a separate directory that many users are unaware of and may not know how to control.
Sandra Person Burns is among those taking legal action against companies that track computer users activity on the Internet.
Ms. Person Burns a claimant who is to be represented by KamberLaw said she knew cookies existed but did not know about Flash cookies.I thought that in all the instructions that I followed to purge my system of cookies I thought I had done that and I discovered I had not she said. My information is now being bartered like a product without my knowledge or understanding.Since July at least five class-action lawsuits filed in California have accused media companies like the Fox Entertainment Group and NBC Universal and technology companies like
Specific Media and Quantcast of surreptitiously using Flash cookies. More filings are expected as early as this week.The suits contend that the companies collected information on the Web sites that users visited and from the videos they watched even though the users had set their Web browser privacy settings to reject cookies that could track them.
What these cases are about is the right of a computer user to dictate the terms by which their personal information is harvested and shared. This is all about user control said Scott A. Kamber 44 a privacy and technology lawyer with KamberLaw who is involved with some of the cases. The suits have been filed by firms including Parisi & Havens and the law office of Joseph H. Malley.One lawsuit contends that Clearspring Technologies and media companies including the Walt Disney Internet Group knowingly authorized the use of online tracking devices that would allow access to and disclosure of Internet users online activities as well as personal information. Others say that the information was gathered to sell to online advertisers.In August Clearspring and Quantcast issued statements on their company blogs addressing the suits. Clearspring clarified its use of Flash cookies and said the legal filings were factually inaccurate. The company said it used Flash cookies also known as Flash local storage to deliver standard Web analytics to publishers. The post also stated that data was collected at the aggregate level including unique users and interaction time but did not include personally identifiable information.
Quantcasts blog post said that the company uses Flash cookies for measurement purposes only and not for any form of targeted content delivery.Specific Media did not respond to requests for comment. Counsel for the media companies in the cases declined to comment; representatives of companies that had not yet been served with the suits also declined to comment.Some privacy advocates said that despite the companies claims if enough data is collected over time advertisers can create detailed profiles of users including personally identifiable data like race and age in addition to data about what Web sites a user visits. They also take issue with the fact that Flash cookies can be used to restore HTML cookies that have been deleted from a users computer circumventing a users privacy settings.The core function of the cookie is to link what you do on Web site A to what you do on Web site B said Peter Eckersley a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Flash cookie makes it harder for people to stop that from happening.According to Adobe more than 75 percent of online videos are delivered using Flash technology with media companies also using it to serve games and animation to users. The company says that Flash cookies are intended to be used for basic Web functions like saving a users volume and language preferences or remembering where a user left off on a video game.In a public letter to the Federal Trade Commission in January Adobe condemned the practice of restoring cookies after they had been deleted by a user. The company provides an online tool on its Web site to erase Flash cookies and manage Flash player settings. At least one suit however claims that the controls are not easy to reach and are not obvious to most Web users.Chris Jay Hoofnagle 36 one of the authors of a University of California Berkeley study about Internet privacy and Flash cookies that has been used in several of the legal filings said the recent spate of suits pointed to a weakness in federal rules governing online privacy.Consumer privacy actions have largely failed Mr. Hoofnagle said. The lawsuits he added actually are moving the policy ball forward in the ways that activists are not.Complaints about online privacy are now migrating to mobile technology. Last week a lawsuit was filed by three California residents against a technology company called Ringleader Digital saying that the company used a product called Media Stamp that acquired information from plaintiffs phone and assigned a unique ID to their mobile device.The suit says that the information collected by the unique ID using a technology called HTML 5 allowed Web site operators to track the mobile devices Internet activities over multiple Web sites.In a statement Bob Walczak Jr. Ringleaders chief executive said Our intent since the inception of the company has been to build a mobile advertising platform that users can control. He added that Ringleader was working on new ways for consumers to be able to verify for themselves that their opt-outs have taken effect.
John Verdi senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center faulted the Federal Trade Commission for not being more aggressive on privacy issues focusing largely instead on self-regulation.The F.T.C. has been inactive on this front and has failed to present meaningful regulation on this he said. Theres wide evidence that online tracking is not being controlled by self-regulation.Christopher Olsen an assistant director in the division of privacy and identity protection at the agency
said it had hosted a series of roundtable discussions about online and offline privacy challenges from December to March and planned to issue a report in the next few months to address those issues.The agency is investigating several companies but Mr. Olson declined to comment on the specifics.Other efforts to address online privacy are taking place at the Congressional level. In July Representative Bobby L. Rush Democrat of Illinois introduced an online privacy bill that would among other things
require companies to disclose how they collect use and maintain the personal information on users and to make those disclosures easy for users to understand.

pri_250_db,ashley madison website hacked..txt,"Large caches of data stolen from online cheating site AshleyMadison.com have been posted online by an individual or group that claims to have completely compromised the companys user databases financial records and other proprietary information. The still-unfolding leak could be quite damaging to some 37 million users of the hookup service whose slogan is Life is short. Have an affair.
The data released by the hacker or hackers  which self-identify asThe Impact Team  includes sensitive internal data stolen from Avid Life Media(ALM) the Toronto-based firm that owns AshleyMadison as well as related hookup sitesCougar Life and Established Men.
Reached by KrebsOnSecurity late Sunday evening ALM Chief Executive Noel Biderman confirmed the hack and said the company was working diligently and feverishly to take down ALMs intellectual property. Indeed in the short span of 30 minutes between that brief interview and the publication of this story several of the Impact Teams Web links were no longer responding.
Were not denying this happened Biderman said. Like us or not this is still a criminal act.
Besides snippets of account data apparently sampled at random from amongsome 40million users across ALMs trio of properties the hackers leaked maps of internal company servers employee network account information company bank account data and salary information.
The compromisecomes less than twomonths after intruders stole and leaked online user data on millions of accounts from hookup site AdultFriendFinder.
In a long manifesto posted alongside the stolen ALM data The Impact Team said it decided to publish the information in response toalleged lies ALM told its customers about a service that allows members to completely erase their profile information for a $19 fee.
According to the hackers although the full delete feature that Ashley Madison advertises promises removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site users purchase details  including real name and address  arent actually scrubbed.
Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. Its also a complete lie the hacking group wrote. Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised and include real name and address which is of course the most important information the users want removed.
Avid Life Media has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and Established Men offline permanently in all forms or we will release all customer records including profiles with all the customers secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions real names and addresses and employee documents and emails. The other websites may stay online.
A snippet of the message left behind by the Impact Team.
Its unclear how much of the AshleyMadison user account data has been posted online. For now it appears the hackers have published a relatively small percentageof AshleyMadison user account data and are planning to publish more for each day the company stays online.
Too bad for those men theyre cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion the hackers continued. Too bad for ALM you promised secrecy but didnt deliver. Weve got the complete set of profiles in our DB dumps and well release them soon if Ashley Madison stays online. And with over 37 million members mostly from the US and Canada a significant percentage of the population is about to have a very bad day including many rich and powerful people.
ALM CEO Biderman declined to discuss specifics of the companys investigation which he characterized as ongoing and fast-moving. But he did suggest that the incident may have been the work of someone who at least at one time had legitimate inside access to the companys networks  perhaps a former employee or contractor.
Were on the doorstep of [confirming]whowe believe is the culprit and unfortunately that may have triggered this mass publication Biderman said. Ive got their profile right in front of me all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.
As if to support this theory the message left behind by the attackers gives something of a shout out to ALMs director of security.
Our one apology is to Mark Steele (Director of Security) the manifesto reads. You did everything you could but nothing you could have done could have stopped this.
Several of the leaked internal documents indicate ALM was hyper aware of the risks of a data breach. In a Microsoft Excel document that apparently served as a questionnaire for employees about challenges and risks facing the company employees wereasked In what area would you hate to see something go wrong?
Trevor Stokes ALMs chief technology officer put his worst fears on the table: Security he wrote. I would hate to see our systems hacked and/or the leak of personal information.
In the wake of the AdultFriendFinder breach many wondered whether AshleyMadison would be next. As the Wall Street Journal noted in a May 2015 brief titled Risky Business for AshleyMadison.com the company had voicedplans for an initial public offeringin London later this year with the hope of raising as much as $200 million.
Given the breach at AdultFriendFinder investors will have to think of hack attacks as a risk factor the WSJ wrote. And given its businesss reliance on confidentiality prospective AshleyMadison investors should hope it has sufficiently er girded its loins.
Update 8:58 a.m. ET:ALM has released the following statement about this attack:
We were recently made aware of an attempt by an unauthorized party to gain access to our systems. We immediately launched a thorough investigation utilizing leading forensics experts and other security professionals to determine the origin nature and scope of this incident.
We apologize for this unprovoked and criminal intrusion into our customers information. The current business world has proven to be one in which no companys online assets are safe from cyber-vandalism with Avid Life Media being only the latest among many companies to have been attacked despite investing in the latest privacy and security technologies.
We have always had the confidentiality of our customers information foremost in our minds and have had stringent security measures in place including working with leading IT vendors from around the world. As other companies have experienced these security measures have unfortunately not prevented this attack to our system.
At this time we have been able to secure our sites and close the unauthorized access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyberterrorism will be held responsible.
Avid Life Media has the utmost confidence in its business and with the support of leading experts in IT security including Joel Eriksson CTO Cycura we will continue to be a leader in the services we provide. I have worked with leading companies around the world to secure their businesses. I have no doubt based on the work I and my company are doing Avid Life Media will continue to be a strong secure business Eriksson said.

pri_250_db,80m anthem patient records exposed.txt,"Cyberattackers have breached the servers of the United States' second-largest health insurer Anthem Inc. (formerly WellPoint) and stolen the records of tens of millions of individuals. The stolen data includes full names birth dates medical IDs Social Security numbers physical addresses email addresses and employment histories  more than enough information to open fraudulent bank or credit-card accounts.
Between the types of customer information that was stolen and the sheer volume of records involved the Anthem breach looks to be quite serious. If you think you may have been affected in this data breach read on to see what you can do to protect yourself from identity theft.
Though the thieves made off with a lot of personal information there's no evidence that they stole medical history diagnoses or treatments. Credit-card data also does not appear to have been affected. However Anthem employees' personal information was also included in the stolen data.
Anthem Inc. has almost 69 million current customers according to its website and does business under a variety of different company names. USA Today reported that the affected database contained approximately 80 million patient records a number that presumably includes former customers.
The affected Anthem brands according to a website set up to deal with the breach include Anthem Blue Cross Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield Amerigroup Caremore Unicare Healthlink and DeCare.
The perpetrators are not yet known but Anthem president and CEO Joseph R. Swedish described the breach as the result of ""a very sophisticated external cyber attack.""
The company is now working with the FBI and security company Mandiant which has become the go-to firm for such incidents to investigate the breach Swedish said in a statement.
Affected Anthem customers will receive email messages confirming that their information was compromised the company said: ""We continue working to identify the members who are impacted. We will begin to mail letters to impacted members in the coming weeks.""
Anthem also said it would offer affected customers some kind of protection services information on which will be included in the notices. Customers of the affected Anthem divisions can call 1-877-263-7995 for further information.
In the meantime current and former Anthem customers should take actions to protect themselves.
If you think you're affected contact one of the three major credit-reporting agencies  Experian TransUnion and Equifax  and ask the agency to place a free credit alert on your file. (Whichever one you contact will then notify the other two). These alerts which last for 90 days but can be renewed indefinitely will notify you if anyone tries to run a credit check on you or open an account in your name.
If you do discover that someone has fraudulently opened an account in your name first file a police report. It may seem pointless but it's actually a crucial legal step. Next contact the credit-reporting agencies describe what happened and ask for a credit freeze which will halt any activity on your accounts without your explicit consent. (Credit freezes can severely complicate your financial life but if your identity's already been stolen you've got bigger problems.)
If you think you're in the clear there's still something you ought to do: Request a free credit report every year from each of the three credit-reporting agencies which will help you keep an eye on your records. If you stagger out the requests you can get a new report every four months.

Privacy Concerns for ClassDojo and Other Tracking Apps for Schoolchildren
Connor Schiefer logs a point for good conduct with the ClassDojo app at Hunter Elementary School in Hunter N.Y.
For better or for worse the third graders in Greg Fletchers class at Hunter Elementary School always know where they stand.
One morning in mid-October Mr. Fletcher walked to the front of the classroom where an interactive white board displayed ClassDojo a behavior-tracking app that lets teachers award points or subtract them based on a students conduct. On the board was a virtual classroom showing each students name a cartoon avatar and the students scores so far that week.Im going to have to take a point for no math homework Mr. Fletcher said to a blond boy in a striped shirt and then clicked on the boys avatar a googly-eyed green monster and subtracted a point.The program emitted a disappointed pong sound audible to the whole class  and sent a notice to the childs parents if they had signed up for an account on the service.

App Smart: With Apps Children Can Play the Game of MathNOV. 13 2013
ClassDojo is used by at least one teacher in roughly one out of three schools in the United States according to its developer. The app is among the innovations to emerge from the estimated $7.9 billion education software market aimed at students from prekindergarten through high school. Although there are similar behavior-tracking programs they are not as popular as ClassDojo.
Greg Fletcher with his third-grade students at Hunter Elementary School in Hunter N.Y.
Many teachers say the app helps them automate the task of recording classroom conduct as well as allowing them to communicate directly with parents.But some parents teachers and privacy law scholars say ClassDojo along with other unproven technologies that record sensitive information about students is being adopted without sufficiently considering the ramifications for data privacy and fairness like where and how the data might eventually be used.These critics also say that the carrot-and-stick method of classroom discipline is outmoded and that behavior apps themselves are too subjective enabling teachers to reward or penalize students for amorphous acts like disrespect. They contend that behavior databases could potentially harm students reputations by unfairly saddling some with a problem child label that could stick with them for years.
ClassDojo does not seek explicit parental consent for teachers to log detailed information about a childs conduct. Although the apps terms of service state that teachers who sign up guarantee that their schools have authorized them to do so many teachers can download ClassDojo and other free apps without vetting by school supervisors. Neither the New York City nor Los Angeles school districts for example keep track of teachers independently using apps.If parents wish to remove their childs data from ClassDojo they must ask the teacher or email the company.There is a real question in my mind as to whether teachers have the authority to sign up on behalf of the school said Steven J. McDonald the general counsel of the Rhode Island School of Design and a leading specialist on federal education privacy law. Since this is a free service he added one wonders if there is some other trade-off.
Sam Chaudhary the co-founder of ClassDojo said his company recently updated its privacy policy to say that it does not sell lease or share your (or childrens) personal information to any third party for advertising or marketing.
Room for Debate: Big Data in the ClassroomSEPT. 24 2014
We have committed in the terms of service to never selling the data Mr. Chaudhary said. Its the users own data.The company plans to generate revenue by marketing additional services like more detailed behavior analyses to parents.But ClassDojo could make money from the information it collects in other ways. Another section of the privacy policy says the company may show users advertisements based in part on your personally identifiable information.
A screen shot from ClassDojo's website shows a demo of the negative behaviors the app can catalog.
Mr. Chaudhary said ClassDojo gave students feedback as a way of encouraging them to develop skills like leadership and teamwork. Some special-education teachers also use the program to set individualized goals with students and their parents.Kids are being judged at school every day Mr. Chaudhary said. They are just being judged on a narrow set of things. If we can broaden that set its a good thing.But critics say that the kind of classroom discipline that Class Dojo promotes is not made effective by packaging it in an app that awards virtual badges for obedience.This is just a flashy digital update of programs that have long been used to treat children like pets bribing or threatening them into compliance said Alfie Kohn the author of The Myth of the Spoiled Child and other books on learning and child-rearing.Teachers who use ClassDojo can choose which behaviors to reward or discourage. Kelly Connolly-Hickey an English teacher at West Babylon Senior High School in West Babylon N.Y. rewards students who brought in supplies or brightened someones day while docking points for cellphone use.
Knowing that they are being graded on how they behave and participate every day makes it easier for them to stay on task Ms. Connolly-Hickey said of her students.She added that she had not read ClassDojos policies on handling student data but that she had shown the principal of her school how she used the app.Im one of those people who when the terms of service are 18 pages I just click agree she said.Teachers can decide whether to display students points or to use the system in private mode. Mr. Fletcher the third-grade teacher said he used ClassDojo publicly in an effort to be transparent. He deliberately awards many more points for good behavior than subtracts them for being off-task.Last month after a well-mannered class discussion about the motivations of characters in a picture book Mr. Fletcher invited each student to the white board to award him- or herself a point for teamwork. With each point the app emitted a contented ping.
Mr. Fletcher said that in using ClassDojo he awards many more points for good behavior than he subtracts for being off-task.
I dont ever award the kids points or take away points without them knowing he said. What I am trying to do is put the ownership back on the kid.
Melinda McCool the schools principal said she felt Mr. Fletcher used the app judiciously and had asked him to show other teachers how he used it.But at least one school is concerned that the app could make a student feel publicly shamed.
I have told all my staff You cannot display this data publicly said Matt Renwick the principal of Howe Elementary School in Wisconsin Rapids Wis.His school also requires teachers to obtain permission from a childs parent before they start using any app that transfers the students data to a company.Parents are also divided over ClassDojo.Some like being able to use the app to follow their childs progress and receive reports from teachers.Its a great way to get the prognosis on your child said Gabrielle Canezin whose daughter is in Mr. Fletchers class.But Tony Porterfield a software engineer in Los Altos Calif. asked a teacher to remove his sons information from ClassDojo. He said he was concerned that it might later be aggregated and analyzed in unforeseen ways.It creates a label for a child he said. Its a little early to be doing that to my 6-year-old.
ClassDojo has received nearly $10 million from investors including General Catalyst Partners Shasta Ventures New Schools Venture Fund Paul Graham and Yuri Milner. Mr. Chaudhary says he and his team have studied ClassDojos effectiveness by visiting classrooms conducting weekly phone calls with a few dozen teachers and surveying 1000 teachers.Such an anecdotal approach does not sit well with evidence-based educators.Thats like polling people in McDonalds about how they like the food said Brett Clark the director of technology at Greater Clark County Schools in Jeffersonville Ind. They are not asking the teachers who looked at the app walked away and said Not in my classroom.

I have no idea why this hasn't made the leap to English news/social media yet but this is potentially big news. A recent submission to Wooyun (whitehat vulnerability platform) suggests that a large amount of users (potentially up to 500 million) of 126.com/163.com email accounts may have had their usernames email addresses hashed passwords secret question/answers registration IP addresses and dates of birth leaked due to a yet-to-be-disclosed vulnerability. Although NetEase issued a denial on Sina Weibo CNCERT is apparently investigating.
http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2015-10-19/doc-ifxivsce6930000.shtml
tl;dr If you use NetEase services change your password and enable two factor authentication and consider detaching your NetEase account from third party services (Taobao AliPay Apple ID etc.). Also if you reuse passwords across services consider changing the duplicates as well.

I have no idea why this hasn't made the leap to English news/social media yet
For the same reason that a lot of ""important"" news doesn't make the leap into China. The netease hack isn't of interest to the general Anglosphere public. I'll bet you'll find it on almost every netsec website.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]HarRob 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(6 children)It will be in the Shenzhen Daily (English) tomorrow. Many iPhones users that linked their mailboxes with 163 were ""hacked"" according to the report.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]ratsta 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(3 children)Sure but not many anglophones will be reading the SZ Daily. It's unlikely to be front-page on the WashPost Sydney Herald etc. Just a point of interest in the tech section.
Were it Hotmail that got hacked that'd be a different story!
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(2 children)The problem of course being that many American companies (banks retailers etc.) do business in China and thus have Chinese employees. The risk to their employees (and thus their company) here is significant and who knows if they catch wind of such incidents if they're not written in English especially considering security teams for such firms are primarily US-based.
permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]ratsta 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(1 child)I never said it was a good thing just that unless the editors feel a news item is of interest to a newspaper's audience the item won't hit the front page.

permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[]condraj2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(1 child)My understanding here is that they either re-used their NetEase password with their AppleID or had them linked as you suggested. In either case attackers could log in and remotely lock (""brick"" in many Chinese language reports) their phone. Sucks.

pri_250_db,explorer launch of google glass raises concerns ab.txt,"YOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollectionsComputersGoogle Glass sees all and that's a worryThe digital goggles could be the next must-have gadget if they can overcome privacy concerns and the stigma of being labeled as a 'Segway for your face'August 11 2013|Jessica Guynn
Erica Pang adjusts her Google Glass for the first time. She and her brother (Peter DaSilva For The Times )SAN FRANCISCO  On a recent afternoon Homer Gaines hiked with girlfriend Tami Stillwell to the gusty peak of Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay bent down on one knee and slipped a topaz and white-sapphire ring on her finger capturing the entire marriage proposal on a computerized device that he was wearing like a pair of glasses.Gaines a 41-year-old Web developer from Fort Myers Fla. is one of 10000 ""explorers"" testing Glass the much talked about hands-free wearable computing device from Google that lets users take photos and videos make phone calls send and receive text messages search the Internet and get turn-by-turn directions.""I would not have been able to pull off that level of spontaneity with any other device and instantly share it with the world"" Gaines said. ""Glass gave me the ability to share with everyone that special moment from my point of view -- the surprise on her face the way she jumped around the ring on her finger and the tears of joy in her eyes.""Glass won't be widely available for purchase until early next year but it's one of the most anticipated new technologies in years. The question many are asking: Can Google make digital goggles the world's next must-have gadget? For The Record Los Angeles Times Sunday August 18 2013 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 53 words Type of Material: Correction Google Glass: An article in the Aug. 11 Business section about Google Glass said that Google co-founder Sergey Brin stole the show last year at the company's annual developers conference by sky-diving onto the roof while wearing the goggles. He wore the device at the conference but did not sky-dive onto the roof.As Google sees it Glass is a revolutionary new way to quickly and effortlessly connect people with information.Critics view Glass as an invasive new technology that -- if it takes off -- could rob people of what few shreds of privacy they have left.Lawmakers are alarmed by the privacy implications and have begun asking pointed questions of Google. And some commercial establishments -- most notably casinos and bars -- have already banned Glass.Google is downplaying the privacy and security risks assuring the public that it will not permit facial recognition apps (or porn apps for that matter). Google says it's obvious when someone is taking pictures or recording a video on Glass.But some developers have already built a way to get around Google: an alternative operating system that runs on Glass but is not controlled by Google. One developer is making a facial recognition app that will help users remember the hundreds of people they have met and should recognize but don't.That in-your-face quality of Glass could wake up more people to their ever shrinking privacy in the rapidly advancing digital age University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo said.Not only will people be more keenly aware that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public Glass and devices like it could make it easier for government authorities to gain access to everything they see and record without a warrant he said.And with a warrant the government might even be able to remotely turn on Glass' video recording capability without the user's knowledge the way it has done with OnStar systems in cars Calo said.To counter that kind of growing apprehension Google is trying to make the new technology seem as normal as possible.Google co-founder Sergey Brin constantly has a pair perched on his nose. He has worn Glass to the Oscars to the TED conference and in the Hollywood film ""The Internship"" and last year he stole the show at Google's annual developers conference by sky-diving onto the roof wearing Glass.His cohort Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page recently sported a pair as a groomsman in a wedding ceremony in Croatia. And he talked up Glass as the future of technology during Google's second-quarter earnings conference call with analysts.Still even inside the high-tech industry some aren't too keen on Glass. Los Angeles technology entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis has asked friends to remove Glass in his presence banned Glass from poker games and coined a new term to describe what he feels like doing when he spots Glass wearers: ""Glass-kicking.""And Glass hasn't been able to ditch what could be its true Achilles' heel: its dorky image. Labeled ""Segway for your face"" it has become the butt of jokes on late-night television and on the Internet. Not only have Glass wearers been subjected to public ridicule for looking ""glassed out"" they are referred to as a cross between Glass and a curse word.Google is the first to admit that Glass is not quite ready for prime time with widely reported glitches. The battery drains quickly (but also charges quickly). The capabilities are still very limited with only a smattering of apps such as Twitter Facebook and Tumblr. And some complain that it's not easy to hear notifications or phone calls with the bone conduction speaker.Perhaps the most glaring omission: A way for the 64% of the U.S. population who wears glasses to use Glass. Google has made a prototype of prescription frames designed to be compatible with Glass and said the company will release specifications for frames manufacturers.1 | 2 |

pri_250_db,a 16 year old girl was sexually assaulted by two s.txt,"Steubenville High School rape case - Wikipedia the free encyclopedia
The Steubenville High School rape occurred in Steubenville Ohio on the night of August 11 2012 when a high school girl incapacitated by alcohol was publicly and repeatedly sexually assaulted by her peers several of whom documented the acts in social media. The victim was transported undressed photographed and sexually assaulted. She was also penetrated vaginally by other students' fingers (digital penetration) an act defined as rape under Ohio law.[1]
The jocular attitude of the assailants was documented on Facebook Twitter text messages and cell phone recordings of the acts. The crime and ensuing legal proceedings generated considerable controversy and galvanized a national conversation about rape and rape culture. Two students and high school football players Ma'lik Richmond and Trent Mays both 16 at the time of the crime were convicted in juvenile court for the rape of a minor. Additionally three other adults have been indicted for obstructing the investigation into the rape while Steubenville's superintendent of schools has been charged with hindering the investigation into a rape that took place earlier in 2012.
In the early morning hours of August 12 2012 a 16-year-old girl from Weirton West Virginia incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond.[2]
According to trial transcripts at about midnight the intoxicated victim left a party with four football players. They went to a second party where the victim vomited and appeared ""out of it."" The same group left after about 20 minutes and headed to the home of one of the witnesses. In the backseat of the car during the 15-minute trip her shirt was removed and Trent Mays digitally penetrated the victim's vagina and exposed her breasts while his friends filmed and photographed her. In the basement of the house Mays attempted to orally rape the victim by forcing his penis into her mouth. Now unconscious she was stripped naked and the second accused Ma'lik Richmond also digitally penetrated the victim's vagina. She was again photographed. Three witnesses took the photos back to the second party and shared them with friends.[3]
In the days following the rapes according to The New York Times Mays ""seemed to try to orchestrate a cover-up telling a friend 'Just say she came to your house and passed out'"" and pleading with the victim not to press charges.[2]
Ohio investigators confiscated and analyzed 15 cellphones and two tablets collecting hundreds of text messages from dozens of students and interviewed almost 60 people including students coaches school officials and parents.[4]
The victim testified in court that she had no memory of the six-hour period in which the rapes occurred except for a brief time at the second location in which she was vomiting on the street. She said she woke up the next morning naked in a basement living room with Mays Richmond and another teenage boy missing her underwear flip-flops phone and earrings.[2]
The evidence presented in court mainly consisted of hundreds of text messages and cellphone pictures that had been taken by more than a dozen people at the parties and afterwards traded with other students and posted to social media sites such as Twitter Facebook and YouTube and which were described by the judge as ""profane and ugly.""[2]
In a photograph posted on Instagram by Steubenville High football player Cody Saltsman the victim was shown looking unresponsive being carried by two teenage boys by her wrists and ankles. Former Steubenville baseball player Michael Nodianos responding to hearsay of the event tweeted ""Some people deserve to be peed on"" which was retweeted later by several people including Mays. In a 12-minute video later posted to YouTube Nodianos and others talk about the rapes with Nodianos joking that ""they raped her quicker than Mike Tyson raped that one girl"" and ""They peed on her. That's how you know she's dead because someone pissed on her.""[5] While he did not sexually assault the victim himself Nodianos a scholarship student at Ohio State at the time news of the rape broke received numerous threats for his comments as did his family in Steubenville and subsequently dropped out of school.[6] In one text Mays described the victim as ""like a dead body"" and ""deader than Caylee Anthony"" and in another he told the victim that a photo of her lying naked in a basement with semen on her body had been taken by him and that the semen was his. In a text message to a friend afterwards he said ""I shoulda raped her now that everybody thinks I did"" but ""she wasn't awake enough.""[7]
On March 17 2013 Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond were convicted of rape after the trial judge found they had used their fingers to digitally penetrate the victim's vagina and that it was impossible for the incapacitated girl to have given consent.[2]
The case garnered nationwide attention after it was prominently covered in the New York Times in part for the role of social media in its development.[8] The self-proclaimed ""rape crew""[9] publicized the event using Twitter YouTube Instagram and text messages. Video and photo evidence reveal that the girl was sexually assaulted over the course of several hours.[8] The video and photo evidence showed her to be unconscious. Some members of the community blamed the girl for her own rape and blamed her for casting a negative light on the football team and town.[8]
Criticism has also been placed upon media outlets themselves especially CNN for their biased coverage of the case.[10] During the course of the delinquent verdict on March 17 2013 CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was ""Incredibly difficult even for an outsider like me to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures star football players very good students literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...when that sentence came down [Ma'lik] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...He said to him 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.'"" Candy Crowley and Paul Callan were also criticized for their lack of focus on the victim and their sympathy for the rapists.[11][12][13][14][15]
In early broadcasts on March 17 2013 CNN Fox News and MSNBC aired unedited footage that revealed the first name of the rape victim during one of the students' post-conviction statements after the guilty disposition was announced. This practice is against the Associated Press guidelines for coverage. These media outlets redacted the name in subsequent broadcasts.[16] Her first name also appeared temporarily in documents leaked by Anonymous.[17]
Congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio's 6th congressional district which includes Steubenville issued a statement on January 7 2013. In the statement Johnson said ""As the father of two daughters and grandfather of four granddaughters had something like what is being alleged here have happened to one of my loved ones I would be demanding justice to the fullest extent of the law."" He stated he was in contact with State Attorney General Mike DeWine about the incident and was confident that the state and local authorities were competently handling the case.[18] On March 17 after the verdict he stated ""This has been a tragic ordeal. Lives have been forever changed because of the reprehensible acts committed by the young men involved. Now that they've been held accountable in court I'm hopeful that the Steubenville community will begin the difficult process of healing.""[19]
On December 24 2012 following national newspaper coverage the hacker collective Anonymous threatened to reveal the names of other unindicted alleged participants.[20] In December 2012 KnightSec an offshoot of Anonymous hacked an unaffiliated website posting a demand for an apology by school officials and local authorities who had allegedly covered up the incident in order to protect the athletes and school's program. KnightSec followed up their December hack on January 1 2013 posting a video featuring the ""self-proclaimed 'rape crew' from the night of the attack making jokes about what had happened.""[9] There are allegations that more people participated in the incident.[21][22] One of the hackers was later indicted under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[23][24] Deric Lostutter who donned a Guy Fawkes mask and was interviewed by CNN was later raided by the FBI with a warrant targeting his involvement in the hacking of a site[25] even though somebody else acknowledged being responsible for the hacking.[26]
Saltsman v. Goddard concerned an effort by two parents of a teenage boy from Steubenville Ohio to stop blogger Alexandria Goddard's website from publishing allegedly defamatory posts about their son Cody Saltsman. The parents sued Goddard and a dozen anonymous posters in October 2012; a legal blogger labeled it a SLAPP suit.[27] The lawsuit asked for an injunction against the blogger a public apology stating that the boy was not involved in the rape and $25000 in damages.[28] The case was dismissed with prejudice in December 2012 after Goddard agreed to post a statement that the boy was remorseful about his role in the aftermath of the Steubenville High School rape case.[29]
On March 17 2013 Judge Thomas Lipps tried Mays and Richmond as juveniles and adjudicated them ""delinquent beyond reasonable doubt"" the juvenile equivalent of a guilty verdict. Each defendant received a mandated minimum sentence with the possibility of remaining in juvenile detention until age 21.[30] The judge set a minimum sentence of one year for Richmond who was found guilty of penetrating the girl while she was unconscious. Mays who was found guilty of penetrating the girl while she was unconscious and disseminating pornographic pictures of her was given a minimum sentence of two years.[31] Because the girl was a minor Mays was charged with and convicted of the dissemination of child pornography which is the reason for his additional year in juvenile detention. Initially it was reported that whether or not Mays and Richmond will be added to the sexual-offenders registry depends on a future hearing to evaluate their behavior once they have turned 21;[7] however both were classified ""Tier II"" (medium) offenders.[32] Ma'lik Richmond was released from detention on January 5th 2014.[33] Trent Mays was released in January 2015.
The nature of the case led to accusations that coaches and school officials knew about the rape and failed to report it. For example several texts entered into evidence during the trial implied that Steubenville head coach Reno Saccoccia was trying to cover for the players which led to nationwide outrage after he received a new contract as the district's administrative services director.[34] In response shortly after the sentences were handed down Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced he would empanel a special grand jury to determine whether other crimes were committedspecifically whether coaches and other school officials failed to report the rape even though Ohio law makes them mandated reporters. The panel began meeting in April 2013. On October 8 2013 the grand jury returned the first indictment of an adult in the case. William Rhinaman the IT director for Steubenville City Schools was charged with one count each of tampering with evidence obstruction of justice obstruction of a public official and grand jury perjury.[35] According to the indictment Rhinaman hindered the investigation by various means as late as the week before the indictment was handed down. He was also accused of lying to the grand jury when he testified before it on April 8.[36] In February 2015 Rhinaman under a deal reached with prosecutors pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing official business. He was sentenced to 90 days of jail 80 of which were suspended provided he completes one year of community control.[37]
On November 25 2013 DeWine announced a second round of indictments. Another alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl came to light when a girl came forward after the August rape. No charges have ever been filed in that case[38] or only after students discussed it.[39][40][41] The highest-profile indictment was that of Steubenville City Schools superintendent Michael McVey who was charged with obstructing justice tampering with evidence obstructing official business and falsification. It was later revealed that the charges against McVey were not related to the August rape. In 2015 McVey agreed in exchange for not facing charges to resign from his post never seek employment in Steubenville education again and avoid contact with anyone involved in the investigation or case.[42] In August 2015 McVey was hired by the Switzerland of Ohio Local School District as an elementary school principal sparking outrage from many.[43] Three other adults were also indicted. An elementary school principal and a strength coach were charged with failing to report possible child abuse. Charges against the principal were unrelated to the August rape case and were dismissed before the case went to trial.[44] A former volunteer coach faces several misdemeanor charges including making false statements and contributing to underage alcohol consumption. It was not immediately clear if any of them had attorneys.[45] Other school employees were reinstated after an investigation into the indictments.[46]
The 2014 Lifetime channel movie The Assault was loosely based on this incident.[47]
Los Angeles-based artist Andrea Bowers exhibited an art installation with the Twitter texts the football players sent out the night of the rape at Pomona College Museum of Art January 21 to April 13 2014 and Pitzer College Art Galleries from January 21 to March 28 2014 in Claremont California. Bowers grew up in a small town in Ohio with values similar to those in Steubenville where she says ""most of the young men were never told 'No' and were culturally given the right to do whatever they wanted"" something that she feels ""needs to change."" She attended the trial to do the research necessary for the artwork.[48]
Brad Pitt and partners Plan B Entertainment production company bought the rights of the Rolling Stone article about Deric Lostutter's involvement in the case.[49] Some criticize the choice of focusing more on the ""White Knight"" than on the rape or the victim.[50]

Politics|Tracking Voters Clicks Online to Try to Sway Them
A few weeks ago Thomas Goddard a community college student in Santa Clara Calif. and a devoted supporter of President Obama clicked on mittromney.com to check out the candidates position on abortion.
Then as he visited other Web sites he started seeing advertisements asking him to donate to Mitt Romneys campaign. One mentioned family values he said and seemed aimed at someone with more conservative leanings.It doesnt make any sense Mr. Goddard said. Im the opposite of a Romney supporter. But ever since I went to the Romney site theyve been following me.One of the hallmarks of this campaign is the use of increasingly sophisticated  but not always accurate  data-mining techniques to customize ads for voters based on the digital trails they leave as they visit Internet sites.

Candidates Change Plans as Sandy NearsOCT. 27 2012
It is a practice pioneered by online retailers who work with third-party information resellers to create detailed portraits of consumers all the better to show them relevant marketing pitches. Mr. Goddard for example may have received those Romney ads because of retargeting software designed to show people ads for certain sites or products they have previously viewed.
Thomas Goddard of Santa Clara Calif. says online ads for Mitt Romney have continued to appear since he visited the candidates Web site.
Now in the elections final weeks both presidential campaigns have drastically increased their use of such third-party surveillance engines according to Evidon a company that helps businesses and consumers monitor and control third-party tracking software.Over the month of September Evidon identified 76 different tracking programs on barackobama.com  two more trackers than it found on Best Buys Web site  compared with 53 in May. It found 40 different trackers on mittromney.com last month compared with 25 in May.The report provides a rare glimpse into the number of third-party tracking programs that are operating on the campaign Web sites  as many as or more than on some of the most popular retailers sites.The campaigns directly hire some companies like ad agencies or data management firms that marry information collected about voters on a campaign site with data about them from other sources. But these entities in turn may bring their own software partners to the sites to perform data-mining activities like retargeting voters or tracking the political links they share with their social networks.
Now some consumer advocates say the proliferation of these trackers raises the risk that information about millions of peoples political beliefs could spread to dozens of business-to-business companies whose names many voters have never even heard. There is growing concern that the campaigns or third-party trackers may later use that voter data for purposes the public never imagined like excluding someone from a job offer based on his or her past political affiliations.Is the data going to be sold to marketers or shared with other campaigns? said Christopher Calabrese the legislative counsel for privacy-related issues at the American Civil Liberties Union. We simply dont know how this information is going to be used in the future and where it is going to end up.
Evidon offers a free software program called Ghostery that people can use to identify third-party trackers on the sites they visit. On Oct. 18 the program identified 19 different trackers on the Obama Web site and 12 on the Romney site. A reporter contacted 10 for comment.Among those who responded Cassie Piercey a spokeswoman for ValueClick whose MediaPlex marketing analytics division was identified as operating on the Obama site by Ghostery said she could not comment on specific clients and referred a reporter to the companys privacy policy. The policy says that ValueClick may collect information about users  like their Internet Protocol addresses Web browsing histories online purchases and searches  that does not involve identifiable information like their names and that the company may share that data with its clients and marketing partners.
A program called Ghostery shows the tracking software at the campaign sites of President Obama and Mitt Romney.
Adam Berke the president of AdRoll an advertising and retargeting company identified by Evidon on the Obama site said the company did not aggregate user data or share it with other clients.Meanwhile Nanda Kishore the chief technology officer of ShareThis a service found on the Romney site by Ghostery that collects information about the links visitors share with their social networks said the company collects only anonymous information about users and does not share or sell it.The privacy policies on the campaigns Web sites acknowledge that they work with third parties that may collect user data.Evidon executives said the tracking companies on the campaign sites included services that collect details about peoples online behavior in order to help mold ads to their political concerns; advertising networks that track peoples browsing history to measure the effectiveness of ads; and companies that record user behavior so they can analyze the effectiveness of sites to attract and hold on to Web traffic.Officials with both campaigns emphasize that such data collection is anonymous because third-party companies use code numbers not real names to track site visitors.Adam Fetcher a spokesman for the Obama campaign said the Web site does not allow its partners to share data collected from visitors with other clients or use it for other purposes like marketing consumer goods.We are committed to protecting individual privacy and employ strong safeguards to protect personal information Mr. Fetcher wrote in an e-mail. We do not provide any personal information to outside entities and we stipulate that third-party partners not use data collected on the site for other purposes.In response to a reporters query about whether the Romney site placed limitations on the collection or use of voter data by its partners Ryan Williams a campaign spokesman wrote in an e-mail: The Romney campaign respects the privacy rights of all Americans. We are committed to ensuring that all of our voter outreach is governed by the highest ethical standards.
Evidon compiled the statistics on campaign tracking by aggregating data from a panel of about seven million volunteers who use its Ghostery program.
From May to September Evidon identified 97 tracking programs  far more than the average site employs a company report said  on the Obama and Romney sites combined. (Some trackers appeared on both sites.)The campaigns increased use of tracking technology represents a significant windfall for online data collectors and ad targeting companies Andy Kahl the director of consumer products at Evidon wrote in the report. But he added the campaigns need to realize that being on top of which technology partners are appearing on their site and ensuring clarity into what these partners can and cant do with the data is essential.Industry executives say the campaigns simply use data-mining to show the most relevant message to each voter.Political campaigns now for the first time can actually reach out to prospective voters with messaging that addresses each persons specific interests and causes according to a recent report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau a trade group.But privacy advocates say such personalization raises questions about transparency.Individual voters may not be aware that the message they are getting is based on information that has been gleaned about their activities around the Web and is precisely targeted to them said Mr. Calabrese of the A.C.L.U. It may be a private message just for me that is not the type of statement the campaign makes publicly.While some voters may be turned off by the customized campaign appeals for others they are expected.Companies are doing it why shouldnt campaigns? said Michael James a New Jersey high school teacher who visited both campaign sites this year to determine whom he would support. The Internet has changed privacy. We cant expect either campaign to pretend were living in the past.

Money & Policy|Tighter Medical Privacy Rules Sought
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is rewriting new rules on medical privacy after an outpouring of criticism from consumer groups and members of Congress
who say the rules do not adequately protect the rights of patients.
Democratic lawmakers and a few Republicans have denounced the rules saying they fall short of offering patients the fullest protections possible. Hospitals and insurance companies seeking to maintain greater control over patient notification generally support the rules. The White House finds itself caught in the middle.The rules specify when doctors hospitals and insurers must tell patients about the improper use or disclosure of information in their medical records. Such breaches appear to have become more frequent with the growing use of health information technology social media and the Internet.Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services issued temporary rules with the force of law in August last year. After analyzing comments from the public she developed final rules and submitted them to the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval in May.At the urging of the White House Ms. Sebelius recently withdrew the
rules to allow for further consideration.We decided to pull it back said Georgina C. Verdugo director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. We had second thoughts. We hope to issue a final regulation this fall.The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a watchdog group estimates that more than five million people have been affected by breaches of medical information in the last 18 months.Causes include the theft of laptop computers the loss of paper records the posting of data on Web sites and the curiosity of hospital employees snooping for information on sports stars and other celebrities.Congress increased privacy safeguards when it provided tens of billions of dollars to promote the use of electronic health records under the economic recovery bill signed by President Obama in February 2009.In writing the temporary rules Ms. Sebelius closely followed the text of the law except in one important respect: Health care providers and health insurance plans would have to notify patients of a privacy breach only if they found that the violation posed a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individual.No notification is required if a hospital or an insurer believes after a risk assessment that the patient will not be harmed the rules said.Deven McGraw director of the Health Privacy Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology a civil liberties group said the standard proposed by the administration was severely flawed.Harm is in the eye of the beholder Ms. McGraw said. How does a hospital or an insurance company know whether an improper disclosure will harm an employees chances for promotion or endanger a victim of domestic abuse?Defending its proposal the Department of Health and Human Services had said that some kind of harm threshold was essential. Otherwise it said consumers might be flooded with notices warning about innocuous or insignificant violations of privacy.
Some senior members of Congress said they had explicitly considered and rejected a standard like the one adopted by Ms. Sebelius. This is not consistent with Congressional intent they said in a letter to her.The letter was signed by six lawmakers including Representatives Henry A. Waxman Democrat of California and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Joe L. Barton of Texas the senior Republican on the committee; and Pete Stark Democrat of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.Beth Givens director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse said hospitals and insurers were often reluctant to notify patients. Few things could be more damaging to an institutions reputation than having to admit that it has lost or somehow allowed others to intrude into its patients private medical data she said.In July Colorado notified 110000 Medicaid recipients that information about them was on a computer hard drive taken without permission from a state government office. The data indicated whether for example women were receiving prenatal care or treatment for breast or cervical cancer.In the last nine months Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has notified nearly one million people that their privacy could be compromised by the theft of 57 computer hard drives from a call center in Chattanooga. The hard drives included recordings of telephone calls Social Security numbers and diagnostic information about some subscribers.In Massachusetts four hospitals acknowledged this month that paper records for thousands of their patients had been improperly thrown out at a public dump north of Boston. The records included results of tests performed by pathologists and clinical laboratories.We were shocked and outraged said Nancy A. Coley a spokeswoman for one of the hospitals Holyoke Medical Center. We wondered how our records could be out in the Boston area 90 miles away. We found that the records came from a billing agency used by a group of pathologists who did work for the hospital.In California Ralph E. Montao a spokesman for the State Department of Public Health said officials had substantiated 2093 violations of medical privacy in the last 20 months including 26 malicious breaches.The department has imposed $1.1 million in fines on six hospitals and is still investigating hundreds of cases Mr. Montao said.Courtney Berlin a spokeswoman for Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside Calif. said several hospital employees were recently disciplined for using Facebook to post their personal discussions concerning hospital patients.The University of Texas at Arlington said it had recently notified 27000 people of a possible data compromise involving their prescription drug records. The information including drug names and diagnostic codes was stored on a computer file server that was not properly secured university officials said.

Technology|Jobs Says Apple Made Mistakes With iPhone Data
SAN FRANCISCO  Hoping to put to rest a growing controversy over privacy Steven P. Jobs Apples chief executive took the unusual step of personally explaining that while Apple had made mistakes in how it handled location data on its mobile devices it had not used the iPhone and iPad to keep tabs on the whereabouts of its customers.
We havent been tracking anybody Mr. Jobs said in an interview on Wednesday. Never have. Never will.Mr. Jobs said that Apple would fix the mistakes in a free software update that it would release in the next few weeks.
Mr. Jobs who is currently on medical leave addressed the issue along with two Apple executives  Philip W. Schiller the senior vice president of worldwide product marketing and Scott Forstall the senior vice president of iPhone software. A week ago two researchers reported that they had discovered a file in Apples devices containing what appeared to be data of the locations visited by users over the previous 12 months. The discovery raised fears that Apple was tracking its users and prompted investigations by various European governments and demands for explanations from United States lawmakers.
Steven P. Jobs said that Apple was locating Wi-Fi and cell towers not users but would curb the practice and shorten storage time.
Earlier on Wednesday Apple posted a statement on its Web site explaining how its system used the file to pinpoint a phones location.Mr. Jobs defended the timing of Apples response to the controversy saying that rather than run to the P.R. department it set out to determine exactly what happened.The first thing we always do when a problem is brought to us is we try to isolate it and find out if it is real he said. It took us about a week to do an investigation and write a response which is fairly quick for something this technically complicated.He added Scott and Phil and myself were all involved in writing the response because we think it is that important.Some privacy advocates who were harshly critical of Apple last week praised the companys response saying it was a step in the right direction.Apple acknowledged a mistake and they fixed it Marc Rotenberg executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said in an interview. Thats a good thing.Confirming speculation from some security researchers Apple said in the statement posted on its Web site that the file in peoples iPhones was not a log of their locations but rather the locations of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers surrounding the iPhones location which can be more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.
Apple said it used the data which it called a cache to calculate a devices location more quickly than through GPS satellites.But Apple acknowledged that it had made mistakes which it attributed to programming errors in storing the data for a long time keeping the file unencrypted and storing the data even when users had chosen to turn off location services.The system is incredibly complex Mr. Forstall said. We test this carefully but in such a complex system there are sometimes places where we could do better.
Apple said it would reduce the location cache on the iPhone to no more than seven days. The company also said it would stop backing up the cache onto peoples computers and would delete the cache entirely when users turned off location services.
Apple also said that it updated its database of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers by using its customers phones as sensors. But it said that it could not locate users based on the file on the phone and that it collected the information in an anonymous and encrypted form. The company cannot identify the phone user from the data it said.While some security experts have known about the existence of the file for some time the issue made headlines last week after the researchers reported their findings at a technology conference in San Francisco. Apple came under heavy criticism for its silence after the discovery.The location report attracted attention from some government officials including Senator Al Franken Democrat of Minnesota who sent a stern letter to Apple asking why it was secretly compiling the data and what it would be used for. Congressman Edward Markey a Democrat from Massachusetts and Lisa Madigan the Illinois attorney general also sent letters to Apple asking for an explanation of the issue.
Google acknowledged last week that it too collected data about the location of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers from its users.Apples statement contained a tidbit about possible future product plans. The company said it also was collecting traffic data from its phones and tablets to build a crowd-sourced traffic database. That would enable Apple to provide real-time traffic information along with navigation advice. Google already uses Android phones to collect real-time traffic information.Mr. Jobs declined to answer questions about his health or about any plans to return to Apple. Last week during the companys quarterly financial report Timothy D. Cook the chief operating officer said He continues to be involved in major strategic decisions and I know he wants to be back full time.

of 4Age: 28. Educational Qualification: Graduate. Occupation: Call centre employee.
This is the typical profile of a new-age cyber criminal operating from the city. Though in 'business' for a few years the headcount of these fraudsters have suddenly gone up thanks to the ease of making money in this way.
Their modus operandi: get an American or British accent gain access into the BPO industry and then siphon off critical information of callers seeking financial assistance.
""Several call centres manage backend services for banks. This gives its staffers access to crucial information about customers. Hoping to cash in on this they supply this classified information to 'gangs' outside who in turn use it to dupe people"" said a senior police officer. In return they make anywhere between a few thousand to a few lakh rupees on every 'deal'.
Nigerian fraud gangs on the other hand have a different modus operandi in which they purchase information from rogue sites.
""It's impossible to carry out an operation of this nature without the help of insiders. It is most definitely the handiwork of some call centre employees who have access to customer data.They are stealing it and putting it on sale"" said a cyber crime official adding how this data at present is being mainly used by Indian fraudsters who cheat people in the name of offering free mobile recharge jobs foreign trips and lotteries.
Another official explained how the fake job industry has also become a huge source of income for unemployed youth who buy resumes legally from job portals by posing as head hunters and then sell them for illegal purposes. ""They collect about Rs 2 for each resume. While that might sound like a petty amount the deal rakes in a lot of moolah considering they sell thousands of resumes at a time"" the official added.
In some cases these call centre 'crooks' give up their jobs to float their own fly-bynight offices. Some also enter partnerships with teams operating out of Delhi Allahabad and Noida. Together they set up shop and use the services of trained tele-callers to lure customers into shelling out big bucks.
""It is a syndicate of call center employees ex-employees information sellers and hardened fraudsters.It is learnt that sometimes they even employ `brokers' to procure information"" shared a cyber crime expert.
But nabbing them isn't an easy task. Though the local police force only recently caught 14 young men running a similar business officials confess it is merely the tip of the iceberg. ""Most of those who get caught are only small pawns in the game. The biggies always manage to flee.
That's because of two reasons: firstly  it's close to impossible to make those who are nabbed divulge details about the gang and secondly banks from where the data is stolen do not always cooperate with the police"" rued a police official.

U.S.|Duke Winces as a Private Joke Slips Out of Control
DURHAM N.C.  For nearly two weeks many here on the Duke University campus had been aware of a certain senior thesis that a recent graduate wrote apparently as a private joke about her sexual exploits with 13 student-athletes.
Then the Internet seized on it. The thesis written as a 42-page Power Point presentation went viral. And students here again found their school in the middle of a sex-related scandal and annoyed at the power of the murky borderless world of the Internet to wreak havoc and tarnish images.It makes me ashamed that the Duke name is attached to what shes done Nicole Queathem 22 a senior from St. Louis said as she sat in the student union. And its the age-old double standard: people are more critical of what she did because shes a girl.The woman in question Karen Owen 22 who graduated this year from Duke evaluated what she said were her sexual liaisons with 13 student-athletes during her years at the school and she prepared a slide presentation complete with pictures of her subjects and graphs ranking their performance.
Lucas Zidella a German student at Duke said he was amazed at the willingness of Americans to publish very personal details about themselves online.
She forwarded this mock thesis in horizontal academics to a few friends who forwarded it to their friends. After percolating within the Duke community for nearly a week with e-mails reaching alumni overseas and message boards buzzing the report was published online by two related Web sites Jezebel and Deadspin. From there it exploded onto the blogosphere where as of Thursday it was still being shared via Twitter with the frenzied speed of the Indianapolis 500.The fake thesis made its splash just as concern was raised anew about the power of the Internet to invade privacy and sometimes destroy lives. Last month at Rutgers University a student surreptitiously recorded his male roommates encounter with another man; days later the roommate killed himself unleashing a national fury about cyberbullying.All the worlds a stage in the Internet age said Lee Rainie the director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. This is just the latest of a long list of examples of how things that are often meant for small private audiences have innumerable opportunities to become public events because once they have left the creators screen they can be shared forwarded and posted.Ms. Owen did not respond to repeated calls to explain what happened. A man who said he was her father answered the phone in Connecticut and said that his daughter did not want to comment.On campus students were abashed if not a bit fatigued by the notoriety.Just four years ago the Duke mens lacrosse team was embroiled in scandal when a woman falsely accused three Blue Devils players of having raped her at a party where she was to perform as a stripper. One year later the charges against the players were dropped and the prosecutor in the case Michael B. Nifong was disbarred.Seven of the 13 athletes Ms. Owen wrote about were  or still are  on the lacrosse team. This incident has angered many of those who are already sensitive to their image according to students and alumni who know them. The lacrosse players contacted would not comment.
On campus other students had plenty to say.Kishan Shah 18 a pre-med student from Carmel Ind. said the university should not revoke Ms. Owens degree but they should let her know that she has disgraced the school.Mike Lefevre a 21-year-old senior and the president of the student body said that people were not sure whom to be more concerned about. Should we be more worried about the young womans privacy or worry about the individuals who were named? he said. Its not so clear to us who was the victim and who we should reach out to.
Nicole Queathem a senior said a scandal like the one at Duke reflected poorly on the school.
Michael Schoenfeld Dukes vice president for public affairs and government relations said that the education of students about their online presence was continuing and that it was part of the orientation process for student athletes. One wonders in the Duke situation if the individuals were not athletes would it have attracted as much attention? Mr. Schoenfeld said.It was precisely because the 13 subjects in Ms. Owens report were athletes that Deadspin decided at first to publish the report with the names. But later it did black them out. A. J. Daulerio Deadspins editor explained in an e-mail: We are a sports site and running the names seemed pertinent to the story. Plus it had been forwarded so many times and shown up on so many message boards that it seemed silly not to run them.Then I had a change of heart.Jezebel a Web site oriented to women published the list as well. It also published queries from an editor at HarperCollins meant to be a private e-mail about contacting Ms. Owen possibly for a book. Deadspin published queries it got from an agent at William Morris and a movie producer.In 1977 two women at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a similar research rating the sexual methodology of 36 male undergraduates.That report appeared in an alternative campus newspaper under the title Consumer Guide to M.I.T. Men. The intent was to turn the tables on men and show how it feels for women to be objectified. Instead the two women were put on probation with a notation on their academic record for 10 months.Information of course has warped to a new dimension since then.Lukas Zidella 25 an exchange student from Berlin said he was
amazed by Americans who seem not to think twice about publishing details of
their personal lives online.We were shocked by the disregard for the private sphere Mr. Zidella
said.Having grown up in the Internet age students said they were well aware of the dangers.Everyone knows how the Internet works Ms. Queathem said
as she closed her laptop in the student union. Ive always been worried about what I put on Facebook. Im very conscious of future employers looking at it. Its easy to forget but important to remember.
A picture caption accompanying an article on Friday about a former Duke
University student who wrote a mock thesis about her sexual experiences
incorrectly paraphrased comments from Lukas Zidella a German exchange
student. Mr. Zidella said he was amazed that Americans so casually
publish very personal details about themselves on the Web; he did not
say that such an incident would have been no big deal in his own

Four years ago Stacy Snyder then a 25-year-old teacher in training at Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster Pa. posted a photo on her MySpace page that showed her at a party wearing a pirate hat and drinking from a plastic cup with the caption Drunken Pirate. After discovering the page her supervisor at the high school told her the photo was unprofessional and the dean of Millersville University School of Education where Snyder was enrolled said she was promoting drinking in virtual view of her under-age students. As a result days before Snyders scheduled graduation the university denied her a teaching degree. Snyder sued arguing that the university had violated her First Amendment rights by penalizing her for her (perfectly legal) after-hours behavior. But in 2008 a federal district judge rejected the claim saying that because Snyder was a public employee whose photo didnt relate to matters of public concern her Drunken Pirate post was not protected speech.

When historians of the future look back on the perils of the early digital age Stacy Snyder may well be an icon. The problem she faced is only one example of a challenge that in big and small ways is confronting millions of people around the globe: how best to live our lives in a world where the Internet records everything and forgets nothing  where every online photo status update Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever. With Web sites like LOL Facebook Moments which collects and shares embarrassing personal revelations from Facebook users ill-advised photos and online chatter are coming back to haunt people months or years after the fact. Examples are proliferating daily: there was the 16-year-old British girl who was fired from her office job for complaining on Facebook Im so totally bored!!; there was the 66-year-old Canadian psychotherapist who tried to enter the United States but was turned away at the border  and barred permanently from visiting the country  after a border guards Internet search found that the therapist had written an article in a philosophy journal describing his experiments 30 years ago with L.S.D.
According to a recent survey by Microsoft 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals report that their companies require them to do online research about candidates and many use a range of sites when scrutinizing applicants  including search engines social-networking sites photo- and video-sharing sites personal Web sites and blogs Twitter and online-gaming sites. Seventy percent of U.S. recruiters report that they have rejected candidates because of information found online like photos and discussion-board conversations and membership in controversial groups.
Technological advances of course have often presented new threats to privacy. In 1890 in perhaps the most famous article on privacy ever written Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis complained that because of new technology  like the Kodak camera and the tabloid press  gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious but has become a trade. But the mild society gossip of the Gilded Age pales before the volume of revelations contained in the photos video and chatter on social-media sites and elsewhere across the Internet. Facebook which surpassed MySpace in 2008 as the largest social-networking site now has nearly 500 million members or 22 percent of all Internet users who spend more than 500 billion minutes a month on the site. Facebook users share more than 25 billion pieces of content each month (including news stories blog posts and photos) and the average user creates 70 pieces of content a month. There are more than 100 million registered Twitter users and the Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring  and permanently storing  the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006.
In Brandeiss day  and until recently in ours  you had to be a celebrity to be gossiped about in public: today all of us are learning to expect the scrutiny that used to be reserved for the famous and the infamous. A 26-year-old Manhattan woman told The New York Times that she was afraid of being tagged in online photos because it might reveal that she wears only two outfits when out on the town  a Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt or a basic black dress. You have movie-star issues she said and youre just a person.
Weve known for years that the Web allows for unprecedented voyeurism exhibitionism and inadvertent indiscretion but we are only beginning to understand the costs of an age in which so much of what we say and of what others say about us goes into our permanent  and public  digital files. The fact that the Internet never seems to forget is threatening at an almost existential level our ability to control our identities; to preserve the option of reinventing ourselves and starting anew; to overcome our checkered pasts.
In a recent book Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age the cyberscholar Viktor Mayer-Schnberger cites Stacy Snyders case as a reminder of the importance of societal forgetting. By erasing external memories he says in the book our society accepts that human beings evolve over time that we have the capacity to learn from past experiences and adjust our behavior. In traditional societies where missteps are observed but not necessarily recorded the limits of human memory ensure that peoples sins are eventually forgotten. By contrast Mayer-Schnberger notes a society in which everything is recorded will forever tether us to all our past actions making it impossible in practice to escape them. He concludes that without some form of forgetting forgiving becomes a difficult undertaking.
Its often said that we live in a permissive era one with infinite second chances. But the truth is that for a great many people the permanent memory bank of the Web increasingly means there are no second chances  no opportunities to escape a scarlet letter in your digital past. Now the worst thing youve done is often the first thing everyone knows about you.		 1

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Thursday that it was investigating a security breach on AT&T;'s Web site that allowed a security group to obtain the e-mail addresses of 114000 iPad 3G owners.
The group also obtained the identification numbers known as ICC-IDs that those iPads use to communicate over AT&T;'s network.
''The F.B.I. is aware of these possible computer intrusions and has opened an investigation to address the potential cyberthreat'' said Jason Pack a supervisory special agent with the F.B.I.'s news media office.
The iPad owners who were affected included some prominent corporate executives and senior officials from several government agencies including the Justice Department the Department of Homeland Security and the White House.
AT&T; said it was made aware of the breach on Monday and closed the security loophole as of Tuesday afternoon. Although the company said it was still looking into the matter it said it did not believe ''that any other customer information was shared.''
Apple has not responded to requests for comment about the security breach.

YOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollectionsChilling Web Site Reveals a Killer's Obsessive PlansCrime: Liam Youens spelled out scheme in detail but apparently nobody read it. A woman paid with her life.December 05 1999|J.M. HIRSCH | ASSOCIATED PRESS
NASHUA N.H.  For months Liam Youens cried into the silence of the World Wide Web describing his loneliness suicidal fantasies and vacillating love and hate for a former classmate.But no one heard him.His Web site was filled with tirades in which he hatched plans for a shooting rampage at his former high school plotted to kill another former classmate and described his favorite weapon--an AR-15 assault rifle.But no one listened.""Who am I?"" the 21-year-old asked at the start of his Web page. ""Well if i had 20 people buried in my backyard my neighbors would have described me as 'Quiet basically kept to himself.' ""On Oct. 15 Youens broke the silence.He drove his mother's car to the Nashua office where 20-year-old Amy Boyer worked as a dental assistant. He parked next to her car and waited just as he had written that he would. Just as he had practiced many times before.Boyer got into her car around 4:30 p.m. Before she could drive off Youens shot her repeatedly with his Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun. He then killed himself.Suddenly Youens had everyone's attention. On Thursday night he even figured in the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire. One questioner asked if in light of the case it was time to regulate the Internet.Youens was the troubled kid for whom the cracks in the system were chasms. He was teased at school. He never dated. Friendless he ate lunch alone standing in a corner of the school cafeteria.He fell in love with Boyer at an eighth-grade church youth group but never had the courage to tell her. Her friends and family say she never even knew him.A few years later Youens watched her call to another boy on the school bus and decided she needed to die.""I turn my head slightly and whoops 'God I love her.' Oh great now I'm really depressed hmmm.. looks like it's suicide for me"" he wrote on his Web site. ""Car accident? Wrists? A few days later I think 'hey why don't I kill her too?'""That was the basic plan for the next half decade"" he wrote. ""I work fast don't I?""The site which has been removed from the Web provides a rare glimpse inside the mind of a killer. It is preserved in a 489-page police report that also contains the text of police interviews with his family. Family members did not return telephone calls.""One of my favorite things in life is watching CNN and have those words come on 'CNN BREAKING NEWS' "" Youens' wrote on his site. ""Those helicopter shots of people running the SWAT team converging the scene guns drawn. Not as good as the Amy death high but still quite enjoyable.""(Excerpts in this story use Youens' original spelling and syntax.)Clarissa London Youens' mother told police her son the youngest of six children was a loner who rarely spoke to his family. He survived on frozen pizzas and soda which he ate alone in his room. The door always was locked she told police. She couldn't remember the last time she had been inside.He spent hours on his computer which police found filled with photographs of Boyer pornographic video clips and violent video games including ""Doom"" and ""Quake.""Youens who was was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds thought he was unattractive and too thin his mother said. He almost never allowed anyone to take his picture.""In the beginning I was not yet self aware of my own existence"" he wrote on his site. ""La La La my main focus in life was: 'God I hate being made fun of I can't wait to get out of school.' ""Youens identified with Luke Woodham the Pearl Miss. teenager who killed his mother and then shot two girls to death at his high school in October 1997.""When Luke Woodham went on his rampage people called his note 'rambling' and said the shooting was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing"" Youens wrote. ""Ha! what an obvious attempt to put him beneth you. You know full well that he would Never have done it if he was not psychologically abused in school regardless of a passed relationship.""Youens graduated from Nashua High School with Boyer in 1997 and enrolled at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester N.Y. Unhappy living in a dormitory he dropped out after a year his mother told police. Back home in Nashua he lasted one semester at a local college.Afterward he worked mostly unskilled jobs including the third shift at a convenience store. Working nights gave him more time alone his mother said.Youens' only known violent episode prior to the shooting was in November 1996. Angry that his mother refused his plea for plastic surgery to fix his sunken chest he threw her china cabinet down a flight of stairs. He was convicted of criminal threatening and criminal mischief and ordered to attend anger-management classes.Those appear to have had little effect.When he was arrested he threatened to kill himself. His mother told police she didn't think he was serious but on his Web site Youens accused his mother of ignoring signs that he was suicidal.1 | 2 |

Drone spotted in Bible Hill raises safety privacy concerns
BIBLE HILL - A drone spotted in Bible Hill has a resident and police concerned.
Drones have become increasingly popular such as this one used by police. However others such as one that was spotted near a school area in Bible Hill this week are considered a safety concern.

Nattie Turner was outside of her home on East Court Road waiting for her children to get home from school around 3 p.m. on Tuesday when she heard a buzzing sound. When she looked up she saw a black object with extended sections and a bubble-like structure on the bottom.
""My first thought was 'what is this thing?' And then I started walking slowly back to my house"" she said. ""It turned then moved and followed me as I went to my deck. I went in for a phone and when I came back out it was gone.""
She estimates the aircraft was about three feet wide and was just above tree level.
""I felt violated because it was watching me"" she said. ""I'm worried about safety and privacy. If there is a novice operating it there is a danger of it falling. What were they looking for in this area? This is near a school and was at the time of day when a lot of children are around. There are just so many questions around it.""
Turner reported the incident to RCMP and they ask anyone with information to contact them.
""One concern for us if we're using RCMP drones is always traffic safety"" said Cpl. Fraser Firth of the Colchester RCMP. ""They could come down so we cordon off roads.""
He said there are also privacy issues around the use of drones.
""Some of the offences we would explore with a drone being used are mischief disturbing the lawful enjoyment of property and voyeurism"" he added. ""If anyone sees a drone or has any information on who might have been operating this one please contact us at 902-893-6820.""
Truro police said there have been no similar incidents reported in the town.
Drones have become increasingly popular such as this one used by police. However others such as one that was spotted near a school area in Bible Hill this week are considered a safety concern.
I saw it here a few weeks ago on Glenwood drive...lol...same thing really.
I just didnt care I brought my son outside to see it...I know whoever was manning it saw me because it just stayed there while I was pointing it out.
Guess we werent interesting enough because I havent seen it again.
How can anyone. expect privacy when they are out in public? If in a fenced backyard then maybe when out in public you shouldn't expect privacy.
So you think it's ok for these drones to fly around poking into peoples privacy and possibly stalking school children etc.?? Learning their after school habbits etc for unspeakable reasons??
Please tell me you are not in a position of influence or power
I personally own a professional class drone with still and motion shot capabilities. I have always been of the opinion that their should be an easy way to identify these machines. I typically operate mine in close range and most are aware that it's is mine and whats going on when i do. A drone being so close to a school at dismissal time or any time for that matter sets off all types of alarms in my mind. I think this is a matter for deep concern.

iOS apps and the address book: who has your data and how they're gettingit
Over the course of the past week a firestorm has erupted in the world of iOS apps thanks to the discovery that Path was uploading data from your iPhone's address book without asking for explicit permission. Upon opening the app and registering Path automatically uploaded your contact data in order to ""find friends"" that you might want to connect to. Path has since apologized and updated its app but the problem exposed by the episode remains.
Stated simply: any iOS app has complete access to a large amount of data stored on your iPhone including your address book and calendar. Any iOS app can without asking for your permission upload all of the information stored in your address book to its servers. From there the app developer can either use it to help find your friends store it in perpetuity or do any number of other things with it.
Over the course of the past day we have been using the method explained by Arun Thampi (who discovered Path's privacy violation) to investigate several dozen popular iOS apps. Our findings should bring both comfort and concern to any iPhone user  and to be frank the work of doing a similar investigation on Android and other platforms remains to be done.
Presented below are our findings so far but we consider this to be an ongoing project. It's nearly impossible to prove a negative so instead we simply need to test as many apps as possible to determine which apps are uploading your data. Without further ado here's what we've discovered so far.
Update: Apple has finally made a statement on the matter promising a future update to iOS that will require explicit user permission to access contact data.
The way to tell if an app is uploading any data to a server is simply to watch all the outgoing data that it is sending. Fortunately Thampi has laid out a relatively simple way to do this based on a common methodology called ""Man in the middle."" You need to set up a program on a computer in this case mitmproxy to track all outgoing and incoming data. Having done this you re-route your iPhone to send all data through your computer via a proxy instead of connecting directly to your Wi-Fi router or your carrier.
In almost all of the cases we tested that data was fairly-well encrypted as it connected via a secure HTTPS connection instead of an insecure HTTP connection. Also in most cases data was submitted via a ""post"" command though in some cases data was submitted via a ""get"" command which is roughly equivalent to typing a URL into a browser. In at least one case we have an example of an app sending insecure data via this method though the app (Hipster) has since been updated. More on it below.
This method is fairly cumbersome as it requires you to examine each and every outgoing piece of data. It also means that sometimes we can't see everything that's sent and generally introduces some uncertain variables in the tracking process. For example although Dragon Dictation clearly warns you that it is uploading contact names for better transcription we didn't see that data pass though the standard port we were tracking. Again it's hard to prove a negative.
The absolute worst case scenario is an app uploading your address book data without either informing you of its actions or without presenting you with a clear and obvious button that implies what it's about to do.
Until its update Path definitely fell into this category. Hipster also had this problem as discovered by Mark Chang. Hipster deserves an extra level of scorn because it sent its information via an insecure HTTP ""get"" request  essentially putting a large portion of your address book data in a completely insecure URL. Those URLS as we have learned from the Carrier IQ fiasco can be visible to your carrier.
So far we have only seen this auto-uploading behavior from apps that a user might reasonably expect to look for friend
information. We have yet to find any apps that simply grab and upload
address book information for no discernible reason but unfortunately
One app that does it right now is Foursquare as originally discovered by Tapbot developer Paul Haddad. We've confirmed ourselves that upon creating a new account in Foursquare the app sends your address book information to its servers. Again this is surely to assist in finding friends but absent any explicit choice or warning for the user it's a serious problem.
Foursquare acknowledged the issue via Twitter and has promised an update very soon  it may be out by the time you read this. Update: in fact Foursquare has been updated with a pop-up notification that clearly explains what's happening and that Foursquare does not (nor ever has) store your data.
Luckily the list seems small and is getting smaller by the day
Angry Birds can get access but it takes some work on your part
The next set of apps are those that are uploading your address book but do so only when you initiate an action in the app. We are differentiating these apps from the ""explicit warner"" apps that present a standard iOS pop-up dialog when you are about to upload contact information. Instead you'll often tap an element that reads something like ""Find friends."" In all of these cases the user is specifically requesting that the app locate people  though it's not necessarily always clear that your entire address book is being uploaded.
There are some obvious examples of apps that use this method. Twitter Facebook and LinkedIn are all social apps that can and do upload your address book though in each case you need to tap a button to make it happen.
Gowalla will upload email addresses after tapping through ""Find Friends"" and ""Address Book"" without making it entirely clear that you will be uploading that information. Foodspotting is a worse case. Although it does not send any
address book information until you tap ""Follow People"" a few levels
deep it uploads your entire email list in clear text to an insecure
HTTP address. The company told Venturebeat it intends to beef up security in the next update.
A set of apps that is less obvious is games. We have found that a specific class of games can upload your contact information after you tap a button that is not entirely clear. The games are those that connect to Chillingo's ""Crystal"" game service and they include both Angry Birds and Cut-The-Rope. In these cases a user needs to go through an admittedly convoluted set of steps in order to connect their game to the Crystal network but once connected there is a button labelled ""Invite from Contacts"" with a further misleading description ""Send an invite from your local contacts."" Whereas on some apps this would bring up built-in iOS dialog to select a contact in the case of Chillingo games your address book is uploaded so that it can give you a list of names that matches the look and feel of the app. Although this method is slightly problematic it is usually buried deep within an app's settings in a place most users won't bother with because that functionality is already handed by Apple's Game Center (more on that in a bit).
Although these apps do not present an immediate problem as they require user interaction before uploading data there is still a pressing question. It is not clear at all exactly what happens to this
data once it's uploaded. Most of these apps do not clearly state whether
or not they retain your data offer it to third parties use it for
data mining or delete it after you've searched for friends. There has
been some talk about how common this type of data uploading is  Dustin Curtis suggests that an unnamed 13 of 15 popular social apps import and use this data.
We'll also note that it's highly unlikely that most developers are doing
any sort of work to anonymize your information. The vast majority of
apps we tested  whether they upload your address book information or
not  can and do upload other identifying information from your iPhone
including the phone's unique UDID identifier and in many cases even the
""Name"" of the iPhone you enter into iTunes when setting it up.
In short these app developers can get a pretty good idea of who you are and who you know but we don't know what they are doing with that information.
The next group of apps are those that explicitly warn you that you are about to upload your address book information. Many of these it should be said have done so only recently as a result of this address book drama but nevertheless do deserve credit for their (at least current) transparency. Path and Hipster are the two most famous examples (soon to be joined by Foursquare) but Instagram also falls on this list.
Instapaper is another example of an app that tells the user exactly what's going on when you are looking for friends and developer Marco Arment has further elaborated on his security and data retention policies (they're good). Arment joins many others in calling on Apple to require app developers to be equally explicit.
Although presenting users with multiple permissions pop ups can be an annoying pain (and cause them to be fatigued and just tap ""OK"" on anything they see) this behavior can and ought to be the norm.
There is one company that has done more to protect users from having their address books uploaded than any other and its name may surprise you: Facebook. Yes the company that everybody loves to deride (and in many cases rightfully so) for playing fast and loose with user privacy is actually the unexpected white knight in this entire data privacy debacle.
The reason is actually quite simple: many many apps now simply use Facebook to identify and connect users with their friends. Instead of uploading and matching address book information themselves a large swath of app developers instead choose to plug into the ""Open Graph.""
One set of games in particular that might surprise you is everything we tested by Zynga including Words with Friends and Scramble Free. Zynga is inexorably tied to Facebook and so doesn't appear to be directly uploading your local address book information  even in cases where you register directly instead of registering through Facebook.
Now in a sense this offloads all of those data privacy issues onto Facebook but Facebook is subject to quite a lot more daylight than your average independent developer house. What's more users generally tend to think (or at least should tend to think) of Facebook friends as a more public data set which theoretically ameliorates some privacy concerns.
Facebook is the unexpected white knight in this entire data privacy debacle Twitter also gets an honorable mention here with its friend connect feature as it's often used side-by-side with Facebook both for authentication and friend-finding.
Apple's own Game Center software also plays a major role. Instead of requiring game developers to create their own network Game Center offloads that work (and its related privacy concerns) onto Apple. We've already pointed out that Chillingo's Crystal network collects address book information but another common gaming network called Open Feint does not  at least in our testing so far.
There is also a surprisingly large set of apps that do not appear to upload address book information when we expected that they would. Pinterest Skype Flipboard Shazam Pandora Rdio Meebo Netflix Google+ Skype TripIt and Color are all examples of apps where we were unable to find evidence of address book uploads. Granted most of these apps work by downloading their own social graphs rather than asking you to upload yours but nevertheless they don't appear to be uploading that data (again as we've said multiple times now it's possible that any and all of the above are uploading via a method we failed to track).
The policy fix failed it's time for a technical one
At this point it's important to point out a few things. First this issue may not be confined strictly to Apple but Apple is the company that most obviously attempts to curate its app selection in order to protect users. In fact Apple's own App Store Guidlines have explicitly forbidden this type of behavior since 2010:
17.1: Apps cannot transmit data about a user without obtaining the users prior permission and providing the user with access to information about how and where the data will be used17.2: Apps that require users to share personal information such as email address and date of birth in order to function will be rejected
However even Apple cannot fully vet every single app for all the information it uploads as has been demonstrably proven by Path Hipster Foursquare and quite possibly others. The App Store policy is not a scalable solution (though reasonable and intelligent people like David Smith can and do disagree).
There is an interim technical solution that app developers can implement right now and it involves anonymizing address book information before uploading it. Matt Gemmell goes into great detail on how to use ""hashing"" to make contact information anonymous yet still viable for social connections. It's a clever and workable solution but it still requires buy-in from individual app developers.
Another angle is to simply accept Facebook's near-complete monopoly on social connections and trust apps that use it more than apps that collect your contact information directly. While that is a pragmatic solution for now it would be nice to believe that we can find a way to form online social networks without giving all of our data to Mark Zuckerberg.
The proper technical solution is for iOS to limit access to the contacts
database for all apps so that an app must ask the user for explicit
permission to access it. Apple already does this for location
information. Yes this solution is likely to break functionality for a
wide swath of apps and it also brings up the earlier-mentioned problem
of ""alert fatigue"" but neither of those issues should be considered
deal-breakers when weighed against the potential privacy issues of
unfettered access to contact information. As things stand today any one of the over half a million iOS apps currently in the market can access your address book without your knowledge or permission.
If and until Apple restricts access to private information on iOS the best technical solution we have is vigilance. Perhaps an enterprising software developer can construct a ""Man
in the middle"" program to automatically scan for address book data to
speed up testing. In the meantime if you have the technical prowess to examine the data sent by an iOS app please let us know in the comments below and we'll update this article with any new information we can gather.
We've reached out to Apple for comment and we're still waiting to hear back on specific questions related to the matter. We'll update the post when and if we get word.

@maggie_reardonfacebooktwitterlinkedingoogleplusemailcommentsmoreredditpinteresttumblrAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos shares his company's latest innovation: a delivery drone known as an 'octocopter.' On Sunday Charlie Rose reported on the unmanned devices which are still several years away from being in use.Getting a special delivery package from Amazon.com via unmanned drones may sound pretty cool but at least one Washington DC lawmaker is concerned about the possible threat such services would have on privacy.On Sunday night Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos showed off how unmanned aerial vehicles otherwise known as ""drones"" could be used to deliver packages to people's homes in 30 minutes or less during an interview on the CBS news program ""60 Minutes.""
(Disclosure: ""60 Minutes"" is produced by CBS which also is the parent company of CNET.)
Bezos said Amazon is testing the new service it calls Amazon Prime Air which will deliver shoebox-size packages via an eight-propeller drone about the size of a remote-controlled airplane from Amazon's fulfillment centers to customers' homes within 30 minutes. Bezos told reporter Charlie Rose that the service is still at least four or five years away. And he said it would require clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration.On Monday Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) issued a statement in response to the ""60 Minutes"" story urging the FAA to adopt privacy regulations before such a service is implemented. ""Before drones start delivering packages we need the FAA to deliver privacy protections for the American public"" he said in a statement. ""Convenience should never trump constitutional protections.""Markey who co-chairs a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus introduced legislation earlier this year that would protect citizens' privacy when drones are used. A bill he introduced in March would create new rules to protect individuals' privacy from domestic drones.""My drone privacy legislation requires transparency on the domestic use of drones and adds privacy protections that ensure this technology cannot and will not be used to spy on Americans"" he said. Drone regulations needed
Most people know ""drones"" as unmanned flying vehicles used by the military and intelligence agencies in Iraq Afghanistan and other parts of the world for surveillance and to attack terrorist targets. The use of these devices for military and spying purposes has been controversial. Earlier this year Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took the Senate floor in a 13-hour filibuster that asked the question of whether the US should use such technology to kill an American terrorism suspect in the US.The drones that Markey is concerned about are not the ones used by the military to carry weapons but instead he has focused his attention on drones used for other purposes such as law enforcement surveillance as well as some commercial uses like mapping traffic monitoring journalistic newsgathering and now package delivery.The FAA grants permission to use drones but it currently does not offer licenses for drones used for commercial purposes. The current licenses approved for drone use are used by military and law enforcement agencies as well as universities and local governments.As drone technology evolves and commercial deployment seems viable Congress has directed the FAA to come up with standards by 2015 to create regulations and to streamline the process for applying for licenses. This would pave the way for using drones for commercial and recreational purposes. But Markey believes that in addition to rules that will make it easier to use drones the agency also needs to address privacy issues in the new regulation. His bill would require the FAA to collect information from every drone license applicant such as who will operate the drone where the drone will be flown what kind of data will be collected and how that data will be used. Licensees will also have to explain whether the information collected will be sold to third parties and they will also have to disclose how long they expect to retain the collected information.
The FAA would also be required to post information about companies and individuals granted the licenses and list the times and locations that they used the drones.""Before our skies teem with commercial drones clear rules must be set that protect the privacy and safety of the public"" Markey said in his statement on Monday. ""I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on this bipartisan issue to ensure that strong personal privacy protections and public transparency measures are put in place now.""Tags: Sci-TechInternetAmazon PrimeDiscuss: Amazon 'drones' stir up privacy concerns...Conversation powered by LivefyreShow CommentsHide CommentsFeatured VideoSurface makes Microsoft money while the iPhone may be in troubleMicrosoft's gamble into hardware seems to be paying off.

pri_250_db,ubuntu version automatically searches amazon in ad.txt,"Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks | Electronic Frontier Foundation
See part 2 of Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Full Disk Encryption.
Earlier this month the eagerly awaited free software operating system Ubuntu 12.10 was released and it includes a slew of new features (YouTube link) some of which have infuriated users because of privacy concerns.
Over the last couple of years Canonical Ltd the company that develops Ubuntu has been pushing the Ubuntu desktop in new directions with the desktop environment called Unity. A key feature of Unity is Dash a single place to search for apps documents music and other data on your computer. Starting with the latest release of Ubuntu Dash is also starting to search the Internet for you. While some people find this convenient others find it a violation of their privacy. Luckily Ubuntu makes it easy to turn this off. Scroll down to ""How to Disable Amazon Ads and Data Leaks"" to learn how.
The first thing you'll notice about the new Dash is that when you search for something you not only see local files but also Amazon-affiliated advertisements for products. There has been a massive outcry of complaints from the Ubuntu community about this as well as a bug reports both serious (""Don't include remote searches in the home lens"" ""Direct data leaking to Amazon"") and tongue in cheek (""grep -R doesn't automatically search amazon"" ""Spyware coverage incomplete - limited to Dash""). Mark Shuttleworth the founder of Ubuntu defended the decision to include Amazon ads in Dash:
We are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Dont trust us? Erm we have root. You do trust us with your data already. You trust us not to screw up on your machine with every update. You trust Debian and you trust a large swathe of the open source community. And most importantly you trust us to address it when being human we err.
Technically when you search for something in Dash your computer makes a secure HTTPS connection to productsearch.ubuntu.com sending along your search query and your IP address. If it returns Amazon products to display your computer then insecurely loads the product images from Amazon's server over HTTP. This means that a passive eavesdropper such as someone sharing a wireless network with you will be able to get a good idea of what you're searching for on your own computer based on Amazon product images.
It's a major privacy problem if you can't find things on your own computer without broadcasting what you're looking for to the world. You could be searching for the latest version of your rsum at work because you're considering leaving your job; you could be searching for a domestic abuse hotline PDF you downloaded or legal documents about filing for divorce; maybe you're looking for documents with file names that will gave away trade secrets or activism plans; or you could be searching for a file in your own local porn collection. There are many reasons why you wouldn't want any of these search queries to leave your computer.
The new version of Dash that comes with Ubuntu 12.10 introduces more than just Amazon ads. It includes a new legal notice that you can see by clicking the ""i"" in the corner of Dash that states that by using Dash you automatically agree to send your search term and IP address to a number of third parties.
Unless you have opted out we will also send your keystrokes as a search term to productsearch.ubuntu.com and selected third parties so that we may complement your search results with online search results from such third parties including: Facebook Twitter BBC and Amazon. Canonical and these selected third parties will collect your search terms and use them to provide you with search results while using Ubuntu.
Ubuntu's Third Party Privacy Policies page lists all of the third parties that they may send your search term and IP address to and states: ""For information on how our selected third parties may use your information please see their privacy policies."" In other words once they give your data away it's no longer their problem.
Canonical is not clear about which third parties it sends data to and when but it appears that many of these third parties only get searched in certain circumstances. Ubuntu's new Online Accounts feature lets you authorize Ubuntu to use your accounts from Facebook Twitter Google Flickr and other services for Ubuntu apps. Dash will likely search these services for photos documents and other content only after you've authorized Ubuntu to use them.
Canonical has been listening to feedback from Ubuntu users and they are working on improvements to Dash such as loading Amazon images over HTTPS to prevent eavesdroppers from learning what users search for and NSFW filters so that pornography doesn't appear in Dash. These changes are great but it doesn't change the fact that users' search queries automatically get sent to third party companies without giving users a chance to opt-in.
Even loading Amazon product images over HTTPS instead of HTTP the fact that they are loaded directly from Amazon's servers instead of from Canonical's means that Amazon has the ability to correlate search queries with IP addresses. One way to fix this would be if Canonical proxied all third party images and other content for Ubuntu users.
You can uninstall Dash's Amazon integration by removing the package called unity-lens-shopping from your computer. If you are currently using Ubuntu 12.10 you can click here to open unity-lens-shopping in Ubuntu Software Center and then click the ""Remove"" button on the right. You can also uninstall it by opening the Terminal app and typing:
If you want Dash to only search your local computer and not search the Internet at all you can open the Privacy app and switch ""Include online search results"" from on to off as pictured below.
Finally if you don't like the direction that Unity is going but you still like the Ubuntu operating system you can switch to a different desktop environment altogether such as GNOME 3 KDE or Cinnamon.
You can get GNOME 3 by installing the package called gnome-shell. You can get KDE by installing the package called kde-full. And you can get Cinnamon by adding the Cinnamon PPA to your repositories and then installing the package called cinnamon. Once you have installed a new desktop environment you can choose which one you want to use from your login screen. Click the Ubuntu logo next to your username to change your desktop environment.
Ubuntu is the third most popular desktop operating system and it's the most popular free software one. Many of EFF's employees run Ubuntu on their own computers. Here is what we would like to see from future versions of Ubuntu.
Disable ""Include online search results"" by default. Users should be able to install Ubuntu and immediately start using it without having to worry about leaking search queries or sending potentially private information to third party companies. Since many users might find this feature useful consider displaying a dialog the first time a user logs in that asks if they would like to opt-in.
Explain in detail what you do with search queries and IP addresses how long you store them and in what circumstances you give them to third parties.
Make the Search Results tab of the Privacy settings let users toggle on and off specific online search results. Some users might want Amazon products in their search results but never anything from Facebook.
We love that Ubuntu is bold enough to break new ground and compete directly with the large proprietary operating systems but please make sure that you respect your users' privacy and security while you're doing it. Windows and Mac users are used to having their data sent to third parties without their express consent by software companies that are trying to maximize profits for their shareholders. Let's make sure Ubuntu like the GNU/Linux operating system at its heart remains an exception to this.
Stay tuned for part two of Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10 where we will talk about new Ubuntu privacy features that we really like.

Facebook Post of Third Grade Class Photo Leads to Crush Reunion  and Marriage
Christy and Edward Hemmes; Ironia Elementary School Third Grade Photo 1986-1987
Ed and Christy sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love then comes marriage  well maybe things weren't quite that simple for this couple who took a decidedly more circuitous route to ""happily ever after.""
Once upon a time back in the 1986-1987 school year a boy named Edward Hemmes and a girl named Christy Young were classmates in Miss McAlister's third grade class at Ironia Elementary School in Randolph New Jersey. Young Edward harbored a quiet crush on the easygoing girl with the perfect dimples who rode the same schoolbus as him but as Hemmes admits today ""I'm sure she knew I existed but I don't know if she 'loved me' back. Of course love is a different thing when you're eight vs. when you're 38.""
Ironia Elementary School New Jersey Grade 3 (1986-1987) Edward Hemmes
Christy moved away to Chester the next town over (which might as well have been China by elementary school standards) and the pair lost track of each other. That is until one fateful day  Aug. 27 2009  when a fellow former third grader named Eileen posted their class photo on Facebook.
Numerous faces were tagged and various former students began commenting on the nostalgic image. Specifically Ed Hemmes now in his thirties unaware of the in's and out's of Facebook privacy didn't realize everyone tagged would see when he wrote a throwaway comment about his former crush: ""Christy Young (loved her).""
Once he learned that everyone including Christy (also now in her thirties) could read his revealing comment Hemmes posted again this time apologizing to Christy and admitting his embarrassment. Luckily she was amused: ""No problem"" she wrote. ""Flattering to have an admirer.""
""Facebook was still kind of new at that time"" Hemmes tells PEOPLE. ""I understood it then about as much as I understand it now. I thought my comment was just going to be seen by the person who posted the picture. I thought there was no way Christy would see it read it let alone respond to it  We exchanged Facebook messages for a while. Eventually we planned a date.""
Christy's version of the story matches up. ""First we became friends on Facebook"" said the future Mrs. Hemmes. ""Then one night he started messaging me. We talked for a long time that way before he asked me out. I did give him a little grief for taking so long to ask.""
The couple's reunion-turned-first-date was just a few days after Valentine's Day in 2010 at the Corner Pub in Mount Olive New Jersey. Christy recalls talking for hours even after the band started to play. ""Our first date was like meeting up with an old friend. We just clicked"" she said.
Ed mostly agrees: ""Our first date was a little awkward. It was a loud bar ... I didn't know if she drank or what she liked or what to talk about. We both recognized each other right away and after some time talking I thought she had a pretty interesting life and she was doing some things I would like to do. I was definitely attracted to her still. It was like everything I saw and thought about her as a child was grown up and we could actually talk about things that mattered.""
From there they started texting nearly every day. The pair dated for a little over two years before Hemmes proposed  at the very same elementary school where their romance almost-but-not-quite-blossomed so many years ago.
""I had to leave work early and convince her to meet me at Ironia School"" recalls Ed. ""I told her we had to meet someone there and then drop off a car at my mom's house. When we got there the front door of the school was locked and I was as nervous as could be. What I planned to say versus what actually came out of my mouth are probably very different but the point was 'Sometimes one door closes and another door opens and sometimes the door is just locked but being here at the doors we both walked through so many times so many years ago seems like a great time to begin a new journey through a new door.' There is a rumor that when you ring the door bell at the school it starts recording what's happening. It's possible [the proposal] is all on video but we never asked.""
Ed and Christy Hemmes married on Dec. 28 2013. They currently live in Andover New Jersey and have an adorable 16-month-old girl named Emily Grace.
Edward and Christy Hemmes and their daughter Edward Hemmes
As for Facebooking a former crush Ed says ""My only advice is to jump in with both feet. The worst that can happen is they tell you how much they hated you and never want to hear from you again  and like pulling off a Band-Aid it's all over. Usually I imagine they won't remember or respond to you. Sometimes you'll talk and find peace and get over some of the 'stuff' that happens in childhood. But once in a while you find it was meant to be  a long crazy journey that leads you right back at the same place 30 years later proposing to a childhood crush.""
""You just never know"" Christy tells PEOPLE. ""Take the chance and say 'hello.' It could lead to happily ever after or at least that's what we are working on.""

Lebanon library at center of internet privacy debate in shutting off its Tor server
Lebanon's Library Director Sean Fleming left and IT Librarian Chuck McAndrew right have stopped using a service called Tor that allows Kilton Library patrons to use the internet anonymously until the board of trustees votes on whether to continue its use on September 15. They do however take several other steps to protect user privacy and discourage illegal use or use that disturbs other patrons. ""We provide access to information - complete open access"" said McAndrew. Valley News - James M. Patterson
A public library in Lebanon finds itself at the center of a complicated debate over internet privacy and safety after questions from the Department of Homeland Security led the library to think twice about participating in the global anonymous web-surfing network known as Tor.
I was surprised at the reaction said Sean Fleming director of the Lebanon Public Libraries who turned off a Tor server last month until the librarys board of trustees can decided whether to proceed with the project.
The server located at the Kilton Public Library in West Lebanon was the first in the country to be operated by a public library under the Boston-based Library Freedom Project which advocates for open software and privacy projects for public libraries.
Fleming shut off the server after it had run for about a month when Lebanon police raised the issue with city officials.
I can understand the (law enforcement) perspective. Its a really difficult question Fleming said. How can you tell if the bad is outweighing the good? Its very difficult because the whole nature of the project is anonymous. Whats going through that server I dont know.
Tor was not actually accessible at the Kilton library the way the regular internet is available because the library had not downloaded a Tor browser onto the public terminals.
Rather the library was using a portion of its infrastructure to handle traffic for Tor which is a peer-to-peer system whose internet traffic is passed from participant to participant instead of through central systems making it harder to intercept.
Libraries are well positioned to run one of these said Alison Macrina a former Massachusetts librarian who heads the Library Freedom Project. They already have public internet services can afford some of the bandwidth. An individual hosting this could have some issues.
Law enforcement agencies often object to Tor and other systems that make it difficult to trace communication online noting that they have been implicated in such things as child pornography rings because they allow relatively secure trading of pictures and files.
Advocates praise Tor for its ability to provide safety to people who need protection such as abused spouses or dissidents in repressive countries as well as providing privacy to individuals.
Questions about the Kilton Public Library participation in Tor were first raised by the Department of Homeland Security after which they made their way to Lebanon police.
Lt. Matthew Isham of the Lebanon Police Department said police werent necessarily against the idea of the town library hosting a Tor node.
Our purpose is not to shut this down. Our purpose is to inform to ensure that all the departments in the city should know about it Isham said.
The Lebanon Public Libraries Board of Trustees which unanimously supported the project in June is scheduled to discuss the issue at its meeting on Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the main library.
Participation in Tor seems to fit in with the philosophy of protecting peoples privacy a key tenet of public libraries in the internet era. Thats especially true in New Hampshire where state law requires libraries to keep information about patrons private.
Patron privacy is at the forefront of patron service now said Todd Fabian director of the Concord Public Library. We do everything we can to protect their privacy and Im sure that was at the heart of the decision to support Tor.
The support for privacy is why for example public libraries in New Hampshire no longer maintain a record of which books their patrons have checked out. That way nobody can force them to reveal the information.
For some patrons its frustrating. They want to know did I take this book out before and I say Im sorry I cant tell you we dont keep those records anymore said Lori Fisher director of the Baker Free Library in Bow.
Its not an easy thing for librarians sometimes; there are major advocates on both sides she said. But I believe that we need to protect the privacy of people so they can get the information they want.
Amy Lapointe president of the New Hampshire Library Association and the director of the public library in Amherst said there are good reasons for anonymous internet surfing to occur via routes like Tor.
The example used for me was the case of the battered woman who goes into hiding to escape the abusive husband. There are so many ways to track someone electronically now but in a case like that doesnt that person have the right to use the internet anonymously? Lapointe said.
The Lebanon library became interested in Tor after a presentation was given to the New Hampshire Library Association Fleming said.
It was chosen to be the first library to participate partly because it was already involved in other open-source projects such as running Linux rather than proprietary software Macrina said.
It was a pilot. We wanted to make sure everything worked out well before we continue with other libraries that are interested she said.
The group plans to be at the library trustees meeting Tuesday as will a representative of the New Hampshire chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union which supports the use of a Tor node.
We feel pretty confident that we can present a good case to the library said Macrina. This is a public resource part of the public infrastructure.
As for concern about lawbreaking she noted that criminals can use the clear internet for bad things as well. The people who really need a resource like this they cant use the clear internet.
Even if Kilton library decides not to turn the server back on Macrina added other libraries will take its place.
Somebodys got to be first mover but we have many other libraries involved and were going to keep going she said.

Tor is a free software project designed for anonymous communication. The name stands for The Onion Router because it is based on a system that encrypts data in layers like the skins of an onion. The initial technology was developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to help protect military and government communications although it has been enlarged and improved

pri_250_db,photos of naked adolescents (middle and high schoo.txt,"Hundreds of Nude Photos Jolt Colorado School - The New York Times
NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier. Please upgrade your browser.
Caon City High School in Colorado. Students used a photo vault app on their phones to hide the photos an official said.
At least 100 students at a high school in Caon City traded naked pictures of themselves the authorities said Friday part of a large sexting ring.
The revelation has left parents outraged administrators searching for missed clues and the police and the district attorneys office debating whether to file child pornography charges  including felony charges  against some of the participants.George Welsh the superintendent of the Caon City school system said students at Caon City High School had been circulating 300 to 400 nude photographs including images of certainly over 100 different kids on their cellphones. This is a lot of kids involved he said adding that the children in the pictures were believed to be students at the high school as well as eighth graders from the middle school.
The Vault Apps That Keep Sexts a SecretNOV. 6 2015
Members of the high school football team the Caon City Tigers were at the center of the sexting ring Mr. Welsh said. On Thursday night separate community meetings were held for parents of football players and parents of other students to address the scandal which has shocked this quiet semirural community of 16000. The team was forced to forfeit its final game of the season.
Screenshots show two types of ""photo vault"" apps designed to look like calculators.
Because it is a felony to possess or distribute child pornography the charges could be serious. But because most of the people at fault are themselves minors and in some cases took pictures of themselves and sent them to others law enforcement officials are at a loss as to how to proceed. Consenting adults can do this to their hearts content said Thom LeDoux the district attorney but if the subject is under the age of 18 thats a problem.He added that he was not interested in arresting hundreds of children and would use discretion if he decided to file charges.Mr. Welsh said a significant percentage of the student body at Caon City High School had participated with boys and girls involved in seemingly equal numbers. The photo-sharing some of which took place in school was done largely on cellphone applications called vault apps that look innocent enough  some look like calculators  but are really secret troves of photographs accessible after entering a password.While sexting among children is a rampant problem I hope no other school has it at the level we have it at Bret Meuli the principal of Caon City High School said in an interview in his office. But I fear we arent the only ones.Students at the school described a competitive point system that classmates used to accrue photographs. Different point values were assigned to different students. Students who collected naked photographs gained points by adding these desirable children to their collections. Isaac Stringer a junior interviewed outside the high school who said he did not participate in the photo-sharing called the boy with the largest collection the pimp of pictures.The repercussions are likely to resonate loudly over the days and weeks ahead in this small town a tightly knit community ringed by correctional centers where many people are employed as well as tourist attractions such as Royal Gorge Bridge and Park which claims to have Americas highest suspension bridge.
Mr. Welsh the superintendent said in a statement that because a large number of our high school football players were implicated in this behavior the coaching staff and administration after careful thought and consideration decided that stepping on the field to play this weekend to represent the Caon City community is just not an option.The sexting scandal as parents are calling it shocked many and it has also elicited anger from parents who say they knew about this type of photo-sharing for years and sought unsuccessfully to get school officials to intervene. Heidi Wolfgang 41 a mother who no longer lives in the district said in a telephone interview that she had spoken to a Caon City Middle School counselor in 2012 after she found photographs of a nude adolescent on a cellphone owned by her daughter then 12.He told me there was nothing the school could do because half the school was sexting Ms. Wolfgang said. She called the response heartbreaking and said she eventually decided to educate her child at home.Mr. Welsh said that like other school systems across the country Caon City schools had received reports of students exchanging lewd photographs but that he had not been aware of the scope of the issue until recently when officials received anonymous tips through a system called Colorado Safe2Tell.If theres not a lead that takes you to this larger thing going on why would you go there? Mr. Welsh said.Another mother Lisa Graham 46 said her daughter now a junior at the high school had been propositioned by multiple guys during her freshman year. She received unsolicited photos from guys which she immediately deleted Ms. Graham said by telephone. Im frustrated if people knew and didnt shut it down three years ago.Mr. Meuli has been principal for six years and he was assistant principal of the school before that. He said that the school had had to handle a few instances in which a girl would break up with a boy and fear that he would circulate intimate photos of her but that nothing this serious had been brought to his attention before.What to do about a sexting scandal involving potentially hundreds of students was not covered in his masters degree classes Mr. Meuli said  but these days it should be he added.The high school has turned over a cellphone that contains several hundred images to the police and investigators will try to identify the children in the pictures according to Paul Schultz the Caon City police chief. No arrests have been made Chief Schultz said and parents have been notified about the apps that can be used to mask the illicit photographs.Mr. LeDoux the district attorney said the investigation would look into whether any adults were involved whether children were bullied into participating and whether any illegal sexual contact occurred.Amy Adele Hasinoff an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver and the author of a new book Sexting Panic contends that schools need to find new ways to talk to students about the issue. Rather than just demanding that students abstain from sending risqu images she said educators should aim for open conversations that involve guidance in safer sexting with trusted partners.Teachers and school officials think theyre protecting people from harm Professor Hasinoff said. But we know it doesnt work.
An article on Saturday about high school students in Caon City Colo. who traded naked pictures of themselves misstated the distinction claimed by the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park a nearby tourist attraction that employs many people from the tightly knit community. Park officials say the suspension bridge is Americas highest not the worlds highest.

Edward Snowden: how the spy story of the age leaked out
The full story behind the scoop and why the whistleblower approached the Guardian
As he pulled a small black suitcase and carried a selection of laptop bags over his shoulders no one would have paid much attention to Ed Snowden as he arrived at Hong Kong International Airport. But Snowden was not your average tourist or businessman. In all he was carrying four computers that enabled him to gain access to some of the US government's most highly-classified secrets.
Today just over three weeks later he is the world's most famous spy whistleblower and fugitive responsible for the biggest intelligence breach in recent US history. News organisations around the globe have described him as ""America's Most Wanted"". Members of Congress have denounced him as a ""defector"" whose actions amount to treason and have demanded he be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
His supporters argue that his actions have opened up a much-needed debate on the balance between security and privacy in the modern world. So is he whistleblower or traitor? That debate is still raging.
Snowden aged 29 had flown to Hong Kong from Hawaii where he had been working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton at the National Security Agency the biggest spy surveillance organisation in the world. Since Monday morning he has gone underground. Hong Kong-based journalists joined by the international press have been hunting for him. At the height of the search reporters recruited Twitter followers to see if they could successfully identify the lighting and other hotel furnishings shown in the video in which he went public. They did: the $330-a-night Mira Hotel on Nathan Road the busy main shopping drag in Kowloon district.
Knowing it was only a matter of time before he was found Snowden checked out at lunchtime on Monday. It is thought he is now in a safe house.
What happens now? The US is on the verge of pressing criminal charges against him and that would lead to extradition proceedings with a view to bringing him back to the US for trial and eventually jail.
If America is planning to jail for life Bradley Manning who was behind the 2010 WikiLeaks release of tens of thousands of state department memos what retribution lies in store for Snowden who is guilty of leaking on a much bigger scale? The documents Manning released were merely ""classified"". Snowden's were not only ""Top Secret"" but circulation was extremely limited.
For an American the traditional home for the kind of story Snowden was planning to reveal would have been the New York Times. But during extensive interviews last week with a Guardian team he recalled how dismayed he had been to discover the Times had a great scoop in election year 2004  that the Bush administration post 9/11 allowed the NSA to snoop on US citizens without warrants  but had sat on it for a year before publishing.
Snowden said this was a turning point for him confirming his belief that traditional media outlets could not be trusted. He looked around for alternative journalists those who were both anti-establishment and at home with blogging and other social media. The member of this generation that he most trusted was the Guardian commentator Glenn Greenwald.
In January Snowden reached out to a documentary filmmaker and journalist Laura Poitras and they began to correspond. In mid-February he sent an email to Greenwald who lives in Brazil suggesting he might want to set up a method for receiving and sending encrypted emails. He even made a YouTube video for Greenwald to take him step-by-step through the process of encryption. Greenwald did not know the identity of the person offering the leaks and was unsure if they were genuine. He took no action. In March in New York he received a call from Poitras who convinced him that he needed to take this more seriously.
Greenwald and Snowden set up a secure communications system and the first of the documents arrived dealing with the NSA's secret Prism programme which gathers up information from the world's leading technology companies.
Greenwald flew to New York to talk to Guardian editors on 31 May; the next day he and Poitras flew to Hong Kong. (I met the two for the first time in the New York office accompanied them to Hong Kong and joined them in interviewing Snowden over the best part of a week and writing articles based on the leaked documents and the interviews).
Neither Greenwald nor Poitras even knew what Snowden looked like. ""He had some elaborate scheme to meet"" Greenwald said. Snowden told him to go to a specific location on the third floor of the hotel and ask loudly for directions to a restaurant. Greenwald assumed Snowden was lurking in the background listening in.
They went to a room that Greenwald recalled contained a large fake alligator. Snowden made himself known. He had told Greenwald that ""I would know it was him because he would be carrying a Rubik's Cube"".
Both Greenwald and Poitras were shocked the first time they saw the 29-year-old. Greenwald said:
I had expected a 60-year-old grizzled veteran someone in the higher echelons of the intelligence service. I thought: 'This is going to be a wasted trip.'
After an hour of listening to Snowden Greenwald changed his mind. ""I completely believed him"" he said.
The interviews were conducted in Snowden's room which overlooked Kowloon Park. Snowden and the journalists complete with camera equipment crammed into the tiny space. He had been there for two weeks having meals sent up. He did not have much with him: some clothes a book four computers that Rubik's Cube. He was becoming worried about the costs and especially the chance that his credit cards would be blocked.
Even though he was well-versed in surveillance techniques he would not have been hard to find  having signed in under his own name using his own credit cards.
The interviews combined with the leaked documents provided the Guardian with four scoops in quick succession from the court order showing that the US government had forced the telecoms giant Verizon to hand over the phone records of millions of Americans to the previously undisclosed programme Prism.
The Prism story was also published independently by the Washington Post after Poitras a freelance journalist had earlier approached the investigative reporter Barton Gellman who took the story to the paper. Once on the ground in Hong Kong however Poitras began working with the Guardian team.
On Sunday the story shifted from the leaks to the leaker. Snowden had from the start decided against anonymity and Poitras filmed him being interviewed by Greenwald for a video that would announce his outing.
Snowden's decision to go public has mystified many. Why come out? He had he said seen at first hand the impact on colleagues of leak inquiries involving anonymous sources and he did not want to put his colleagues through another ordeal.
So what are the options available to him now? In the interviews he praised Hong Kong as a place with a strong tradition of free speech and a working judicial system in spite of having been returned to Chinese sovereignty. But these courts judging by examples of past extradition cases tend to lean towards being helpful towards the US.
Snowden would likely argue he is not guilty of a crime and claim the charges are politically motivated.
He has been hailed as a hero by some and a criminal by others. He was denigrated in columns in the New York Times and Washington Post. The Post columnist Richard Cohen though he has never met Snowden wrote: ""He is not paranoiac; he is merely narcissistic."" In the New York Times David Brooks offered up psychological analysis writing:
Though thoughtful morally engaged and deeply committed to his beliefs he appears to be a product of one of the more unfortunate trends of the age: the atomization of society the loosening of social bonds the apparently growing share of young men in their 20s who are living technological existences in the fuzzy land between their childhood institutions and adult family commitments.
On Sunday night Snowden gave the last of what had been almost a week's worth of interviews. It was his final night in that hotel room: the final night before his old life gave way to a new and uncertain one. He sat on his bed arms folded television news on without the sound and spoke about the debate he had started homing in on a comment Obama had made on Friday in response to the leaks.
""You can't have 100% security and then also have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience"" the president said. Society had to make choices he added.
Snowden challenged this saying the problem was that the Obama administration had denied society the chance to have that discussion. He disputed that there had to be a trade-off between security and privacy describing the very idea of a trade-off as a fundamental assault on the US constitution.
In what were to be the last words of the interview he quoted Benjamin Franklin: ""Those who surrender freedom for security will not have nor do they deserve either one.""
Snowden recited it slowly. For him it had a special resonance.
He has gone underground for now. But this saga is far from over.

Home / Europe / 244000 German houses to be blurred out in Google Street View 244000 German houses to be blurred out in Google Street View
When it comes to privacy Google Street View has been a delicate service for the Mountain View tech giant to handle around the world. This is particularly true in Germany where it has been required to offer the option for citizens to have their houses removed.
Googles Street View software automatically blurs out faces and vehicle numberplates to help preserve individuals privacy. In Germany where the service is yet to launch houses were added as an optional extra that citizens could apply to have blurred. Initialy they had to send a letter to Google although more recently an online form wasintroducedto make the process easier.
The deadline for users to apply for this extra privacy measure ended six days ago and Google has nowrevealed exactly how many people want to live in a blurry Street View house. In the 20 German cities in which Street View is launching in first 244237 opt-outs from a total of 8458084 households were received equalling a 2.89% rate.
So why do some Germans fear their houses being featured on Googles service? Quoted recently by Deutsche Welle newspaper publisher Georg Schaeff explained: The problem with Google Street View is that Google  without asking  has gone and photographed German houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used. Deutsche Welle went on to explain that The countrys highest court has affirmed citizens rights to control who has their personal information and how its used.
In short Germany is one strict place for privacy. Still with an opt-out rate of under 3% its clear that many Germans either arent too concerned or simply werent aware of the issue.
Google says that Street View will launch in twenty German cities within weeks.

'Autocomplete' Privacy Violations: Court Orders Google To Delete Results
A German court ruled Tuesday that Google's ""Autocomplete"" feature on search terms violates privacy laws in some cases. The company has been ordered to remove any suggestions that violate the rules. An entrepreneur sued after the algorithm linked him with Scientology.
A Google auto-search for Bettina Wulff the former German first lady.
In a significant ruling against Google on Tuesday in Germany the country's Federal Court of Justice ordered that the search engine giant must remove recommended search results created by its ""Autocomplete"" function if they are deemed to violate an individual's right to privacy. The feature is notorious in Germany after it began suggesting results for the wife of former German President Christian Wulff suggesting she might have been a prostitute or had an affiliation with a red-light district.
In the court's words the company is not obligated to review the software-generated suggestions in advance. The company would only be held liable once it had knowledge of an illegal violation of a person's privacy rights. Google would then be required to remove the objectionable terms from the automated suggestions.
With its decision the court overturned an earlier ruling by the Cologne Higher Regional Court and sent the case back for further review. The case was not centered on Bettina Wulff but rather an entrepreneur whose name had automatically been associated with the terms ""Scientology"" and ""swindle"" by the search engine's Autocomplete feature.
In his case the plaintiff sought to have Google prohibited from connecting his name on its search engine with those terms. Last year the Cologne court rejected his case and ruled in Google's favor. The Internet giant had argued that search suggestions merely reflect the searches conducted by users of its service.
Although not directly connected to Bettina Wulff who has since separated from her husband the ruling is expected to have an impact on her case which had been delayed because of the current proceedings. Google first implemented the Autocomplete function in its search engine in 2009. When users begin to type in a search phrase Google automatically suggests possible endings for the search term to save them time and also show what terms are trending.

Etsy Privacy Debacle: Site Changes Defaults After Exposing Users' Real Names Purchases (UPDATED)
[NOTE: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Etsy had revealed users' email addresses. Etsy does not publicly display the email addresses of its users. We regret the error.]
Online vintage and craft marketplace Etsy recently sparked outrage after the site's buyers suddenly discovered that their feedback posts purchases user profiles and in some cases their real names had been made public and searchable.
On Tuesday Etsy bowed to customers' demands and tweaked its privacy defaults after users took to the the site's public forums with complaints and concerns about their intimate purchases popping up in Google searches.
Ars Technica highlights some of the extreme cases in which users were able to uncover the real-world identities of Etsy users who had recently purchased or left feedback for sex toy listings. Writes one user according to Ars Technica: ""Found an XXL glass dildo with veins and swirled gold coloring (beautiful piece really) and checked to see if anyone favorited it. Someone did. She also favorited some cosplay cat eat hats [sic] and a bell collar/necklace thing. Then I found her on Facebook.""
""I just found a woman who's Etsy profile comes up on Google as the 5th link. I was expecting 6 or 7 pages down but it's on the very first page right after her online resumes"" wrote one concerned user on the Penny Arcade forums. ""She signed up a year ago under the old privacy policy and hasn't logged in since 2010. And now I know what dildo she uses. Right down to the curvature and coloring.""
Last week the site rolled out a People Search tool which let users search for other users by name. Designed to make Etsy more ""social"" the new search feature was intended to help users create ""Circles"" of friends who could view one another's purchased and ""favorited"" items. Users' purchasing histories had previously been public on Etsy but only sellers were searchable by name writes Gothamist. The People Search feature apparently made everyone searchable--buyers and sellers alike.
Buyers are claiming that Etsy did not give adequate notification before making the change according to Ars Technica.
Etsy CEO Rob Kalin and COO Adam Freed responded to the controversy in a post on the Etsy Blog. They wrote:
Were there changes to Etsy that made my purchases public?
No. The issue here is our Feedback system which has not changed in six years. We do not directly publish your purchases on Etsy. However when a seller leaves feedback for an item you bought or you leave feedback for an item you purchased we would link to the item. Our Feedback system has always worked this way; our original thinking was that it's important to know more about the transaction to better establish trust in the marketplace.
We added the option to enter your real name when registering. Right next to this text field it says: ""Your full name will appear on your public profile. This is optional."" Some people enter their name some don't. As of right now 25% of people (including us) have entered their real name.
It is the confluence of these two things that led us to this position: if you enter your real name purchase an item and the seller leaves feedback for this item this purchase will be publicly visible via our Feedback system. Search engines index our site which means this data can turn up there too. It's been this way since October. [...]
We believe that markets are conversations. We want people to discuss what they purchase although this will often mean discussing it in private. As such we have removed the link from a piece of feedback (which is public) to the item that was purchased (which is now private).
UPDATE: Etsy further clarified how it has revised its privacy policy following outcry in a Q&A; post in the site's forums. Writes Etsy
From now on all purchases and feedback are set to private. [...] When others view your feedback they will not see your username real name or details about the item you purchased.
Purchases and feedback will be private for both buyers and sellers. Sellers' feedback ratings will still be visible as will a seller's feedback left for others.
Etsy is also working to mitigate the damage done by the indexing of users' feedback in search information that linked to details about users' purchases and personal information.
""We are working to remove existing Etsy feedback pages from Googles index. Feedback pages will not be indexed by Google and other search engines going forward"" according to the post.
In addition the Q&A; post also includes a direct link to the privacy settings which users can modify according to preference. We have contacted Etsy for comment.

Microsoft Will Remove Do Not Track As The Default Setting In Its New Browsers
Posted Apr 3 2015 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl)
Weekends Are The Best Time To Promote Most Apps StudyFinds
Microsoft today announced that going forward it will not turn on the Do Not Track feature in the upcoming versions of Internet Explorer and Spartan by default.
The Do Not Track setting in many popular browsers tells websites and their advertisers that you want to opt out of third-party tracking for advertising purposes. All of the major browser vendors including Google Mozilla Opera Apple and Microsoft support this feature but whether advertisers honor the users request  and its no more than a request sent by the browser  is up to them. And most probably dont.
Microsoft started enabling Do Not Track as the default setting with the launch of Internet Explorer 10. Unsurprisingly this created a bit of a controversy. Previous to Microsofts decision advertisers had agreed to honor Do Not Track as long as it wasnt the default setting. They argued that the decision not to be tracked should be made by the user and not the browser vendor. Microsoft stuck to its guns saying users could always opt out during the setup process and Do Not Track remained the default  until now (and the number of advertisers that honored it remained low).
Chrome and Firefox leave Do Not Track off by default.
Today the company is reversing its stand. Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer Brendon Lynch argues that its doing so in order to comply with the latest draft of the official W3C standard for Do Not Track. This new draft explicitly notes that the signal sent MUST reflect the users preference not the choice of some vendor institution site or network-imposed mechanism outside the users control; this applies equally to both the general preference and exceptions.
Put simply we are updating our approach to DNT to eliminate any misunderstanding about whether our chosen implementation will comply with the W3C standard Lynch writes today. Without this change websites that receive a DNT signal from the new browsers could argue that it doesnt reflect the users preference and therefore choose not to honor it.
Given the voluntary nature ofDo Not Track it probably doesnt matter all that much whether you turn it on or off anyway. If you want to make sure you arent tracked using tools like Disconnect and add-ons like Ghostery uBlock and the EFFs Privacy Badger is more effective anyway  at least on the desktop.

In a case that might have First Amendment consequences and will certainly strike fear in the hearts of anonymous trolls a Virginia appeals court upheld a contempt ruling against Yelp demanding that it release the identities of seven reviewers whom a carpet cleaner intends to sue for defamation.
Joe Hadeed of Alexandria's Hadeed Carpet Cleaning is meticulous about responding to reviewers of his business on Yelp but in mid-2012 he noticed several negative reviews whose writers didn't seem to show up on his customer rolls. Since that would mean they'd made up their accusations of ""shoddy service"" Hadeed sued them for making defamatory statements according to Tuesday's court opinion.
Except since he didn't know who to sue he got a subpoena for Yelp to release info about the reviewers' identities. Yelp threw Hadeed shade so he won a court order of contempt against the company.
Alexandria's state Court of Appeals said that order was legit. ""While 'an internet user does not shed his free speech rights at the log-in screen' the right to speak with anonymity is not absolute Judge William Petty said for the majority"" according to Courthouse News Service:
""Generally a Yelp review is entitled to First Amendment protection because it is a person's opinion about a business that they patronized"" Petty wrote. ""But this general protection relies upon an underlying assumption of fact: that the reviewer was a customer of the specific company and he posted his review based on his personal experience with the business. If this underlying assumption of fact proves false... the review is based on a false statement of fact - that the reviewer is writing his review based on personal experience. And 'there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.'""
It seems like a bit of a fishing expedition wrapped around a catch-22: Hadeed suspects that the reviewers aren't customers and if they're making up facts they lose First Amendment protection and are liable for defaming him. But Hadeed can't possibly prove that until he knows their identities which requires a court to rule that First Amendment protections don't apply.
No matter; the court broke that catch-22 for Hadeed in part because Virginia laws about unmasking anonymous internet users favored him. ""[T]he Doe defendants have a constitutional right to speak anonymously over the Internet"" Petty wrote. ""However that right must be balanced against Hadeed's right to protect its reputation.""
Perhaps Hadeed's reputation would benefit from less time in court and more time on the job. He averages between 1 and three stars now on Yelp. Reviewers on multiple Yelp pages call the business ""flat-out dishonest"" and ""high priced"" say he holds rugs ""hostage"" and fret that their ""carpets looked worse after Hadeed 'cleaned' them.""
They were the brave ones. ""[I]f he doesn't like your anonymous Yelp review"" wrote user ""Peter B."" of Deep River Conn. ""he will literally make a federal case out if it.""
